00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,770
The Japanese test is over.

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,740
<i>They're really happy.</i>

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,700
<i>They must have put
a lot into this test.</i>

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,330
<i>How heartwarming.</i>

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,370
The test is over...
Rock, paper, scissors!

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,000
That's not rock-paper-scissors!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,960
I'm dreaming.
I must be dreaming...

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,290
It's over... It's all over!

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,130
My parents will give a bag of rice to everyone in this classroom!

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,340
Thanks, rice merchant!

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,470
We're getting married.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,680
Come on, everyone! Lend a hand.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,100
Ready, and...

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,980
What are you doing?

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,790
Tattaima hajimete kizuita
I only just noticed

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,410
that I fell in love
Koi ni ochita no da naa

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,040
You are on my mind all day, day, day
24h kimiOkimiOkimiO

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,880
and I can't do anything about it
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen!

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,290
Somehow
Nanka

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,090
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,880
with you
Futari

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,720
you seem different from usual, could it be...
Gikochinai kaiwa masaka

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,670
Mutual love?

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,930
Nah, it's one-sided

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,510
Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,140
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,060
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,110
This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,780
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kanaa

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,540
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,160
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,920
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,540
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,250
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation
Yayayacchatta kaiwa kami makuri

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,840
Awkward silence, mmhmmhmhm
Kimazui chinmoku mamimumemo

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,760
I want
Kimi no

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,430
to know your feelings

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,350
O-o-one-one-sided love
KakakataOkataomoi

39
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,390
My first love

40
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,270
on my normal way to school
Itsumo no tsuugakuro

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,690
I DO fall in love!

43
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,360
I feel like I can fly in the sky
Sora mo tobesou sa

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,610
O-o-one-one-sided love

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh, Mio.

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Good morning.

Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

50
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,070
Aren't you going to be all,
"Why are you wearing that?"

51
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,530
Geez, you're still
mad at me, aren't you?

52
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,580
For putting a knight
in your mont blanc...

53
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,330
It wasn't like I couldn't
eat it, so it doesn't matter.

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,090
Like hell it doesn't!

55
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,720
I was looking forward
to that mont blanc!

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,430
Why? Why? Why on earth
would you do that? I don't get it!

57
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,800
Why would you
put a knight in it?

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,220
Well, I thought it
would look cool.

59
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,230
Head!

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,400
She can never take a joke...

61
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,830
<i>That idiot.</i>

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,000
<i>They only make ten of
those mont blancs a day.</i>

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,840
<i>She always messes with me without thinking about what she's doing.</i>

64
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,050
<i>Now that she's in college,</i>

65
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,840
<i>she really should
learn some sympathy.</i>

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,220
<i>But to tell the truth,</i>

67
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,020
<i>I'm thinking about letting my
sister's stupidity slide for today.</i>

68
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:19,980
<i>Because I've been hiding a shortcake
that they only make five times a day...</i>

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,700
<i>King.</i>

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,820
Checkmate!

71
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,700
My strawberry!

72
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,250
<i>My rare, only-made-five-times-per-day strawberry,</i>

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,920
<i>that I've been looking
forward to since last night!</i>

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,670
<i>My... my... strawberry!</i>

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,800
Where's the strawberry?

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,970
Where's the sweet treat that
belongs in this position?

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,890
Amen...

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,230
Gut!

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Waah, you idiot!

80
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,610
A shortcake without its
strawberry is just bread.

81
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,820
It's just regular sweet bread.

82
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,410
I don't want bread.

83
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:30,970
Happy birthday to me.

84
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,020
Happy birthday dear me...

85
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,020
Happy birthday to me!

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,990

93
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
I've always wanted to come here.

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,200
You said you saw it in a magazine?

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,620
Yeah, yeah! Look, I've
even got my coupon.

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,080
You don't need to show us now.

97
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,490
I'll have the herring soup.

98
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh? Chosen like a
true connoisseur...

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,250
Without the herring.

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,210
That's just plain soup.

101
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,710
Mio, what are you having?

102
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,760
I'll just have regular cold noodles.

103
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,600
That's the safe choice...
As expected from an amateur.

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,760
It doesn't matter.
What are you having?

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,310
I think I'll try the fried
summer vegetable bowl.

106
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,600
Ordering a rice dish at a soup
restaurant is pretty bold, right?

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah, pretty cool.

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,230
Isn't it? And it's a seasonal dish.

109
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,280
If I don't have it now, who knows
when I'll get another chance?

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,700
Wouldn't that be in a year?

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,780
No, no, no...

112
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,700
You've got to dream bigger, Mio.

113
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
The important thing is
the present... right now.

114
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,620
I see.

115
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,380
Maybe you're a bit too
young to understand.

116
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,130
Yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,840
Excuse me.

118
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,140
I'll take your orders.

119
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,060
One herring soup, one
order of cold noodles, and...

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,190
And one fried summer vegetable bowl.

121
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,440
That's one herring soup, one order of cold
noodles, and one fried summer vegetable bowl.

122
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Just a moment.

123
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,030
Apparently, they make
their own noodles by hand.

124
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,330
This place is the real deal.

125
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,250
What are the
"buckwheat dumplings"?

126
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,290
They're those squishy things
made from buckwheat powder.

127
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,250
Oh, really?

128
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,880
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,340
Here is your herring soup
and your cold noodles.

130
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,020
You two go ahead and eat.

131
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Thanks.

132
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,270
Before it gets cold.

133
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,810
Mine was already cold.

134
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,020
<i>My order was from
the limited menu.</i>

135
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,480
<i>They must be taking their
time to carefully prepare it.</i>

136
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,550
They're taking a while
for yours, Yukko.

137
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,590
Maybe it takes time
to fry the vegetables.

138
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,550
Or maybe they're out
getting the vegetables now.

139
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,890
Ah, that would
totally explain the wait.

140
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,450
This place has lots
of a la carte dishes.

141
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,830
Really?

142
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes?

143
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,290
It wasn't hers.

144
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,300
Too bad.

145
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,090
Goddamn!

146
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,220
Yukko, calm down!

147
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,140
Why should I calm down?
This is taking way too long!

148
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,470
I don't care about their reputation!

149
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,810
They might keep the flavor,
but they're not keeping the spirit!

150
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,060
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm going to lodge a complaint!

152
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Thank you for waiting.

153
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,150
Don't you agree this took too...

154
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,490
Thank you.

155
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,460
You can read a
magazine or something.

156
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,090
I'll be finished soon.

157
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,220
Things we think are cool!

158
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,400

164
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,070
Well, even the smallest mosquito
will turn from being trodden on.

Let's relax and sleep peacefully.

166

I've committed a petty murder.

169
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,230
I'll kill you!

<i>No matter how many I kill,
they never learn their lesson.</i>

171

Do you have any
idea what time it is?

176
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,640
Shut up and go to bed!

177
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,680
Scatterred sushi.

178
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,220
Go.

179
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,220
Scittored sasho.

180
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,730
No.

181
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,230
Scat-ter-ed-su-shi.

182
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,940
Go.

183
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,570
Scit-tor-ed-sa-sho.

184
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,070
No, no!

185
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,610
Scat.

186
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,780
Ter.

187
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,370
Ed.

188
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,830
Su.

189
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,830
Shi.

190
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,540
Yes!

191
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,540
Scattered sushi.

192
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,000
Go.

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,040
Scittored sasho.

194
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,760
Self Control

195
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,720

Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 38

198
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,110
The "Winner" on my popsicle
is sticking out from the bottom.
Winner

199
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,240
Huh?

200
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,910
What do you mean, huh?

201
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,990
You shouldn't be
eating that thing.

202
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,660
What do you mean, that thing?

203
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,040
You won't have
room for your dinner.

204
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,040
Omelette rice!

205
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,880
You're definitely still a kid if you're
getting excited over a winning popsicle.

206
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,550
It wasn't just any winning popsicle.

207
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,630
It was a super rare one, with the
"Winner" coming out from the bottom!

208
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,970
Top or bottom,
a winner's a winner.

209
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,260
If you eat enough of
them, you're bound to win.

210
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,350
Geez, it sure is
blissful to be a child...

211
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,060
Getting so worked up
over a winning popsicle.

212
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,310
A crab!

213
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,440
I hardly ever see this
super rare critter!

214
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,110
I'll save it for last.

215
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,660
Thank you for the food.

216
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,750
Huh? You haven't touched
your food, Professor.

217
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,830
Did you snack a
lot this afternoon?

218
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,880
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,380
Oh, how much did you eat?

220
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,220
All of them.

221
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,640
All of them? You ate all
the snacks for the month?

222
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,520
That wasn't a compliment!

223
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,730
You're unbelievable.

224
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,690
But Sakamoto told me to eat them.

225
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,900
Mr. Sakamoto!

226
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,200
Sakamoto told me that food
spoils fast during the summer.

227
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,660
That has nothing to do with it.

228
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,960
But you said there's
always room for dessert.

229
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,670
What are you, an office lady?

230
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,460
Mr. Sakamoto!

231
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,670
Why are you taking her seriously?

232
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,050
I'm innocent!

233
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,420
If we're talking black or white, I'm white!

234
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,010
You're pure black.

235
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,760
That's right.

236
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,550
Hey, I was born this way!

237
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,140
Just forget it.

238
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,350
There's nothing else to say.

239
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,640
You're not getting
any strawberry juice.

240
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,940
I won't eat any more snacks!

241
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,150
No.

242
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,320
I'll give you my winning popsicle!

243
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,190
I don't want it.

244
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,530
I'll eat my vegetables!

245
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,990
That goes without saying.

246
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,290
I'll remove your key.

247
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,500
What?

248
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,920
I-I'll forgive you this time.

249
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,720
But if you do it again,
no snacks for a month.

250
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,680
Okay!

251
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,890
Well, then...

252
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,930
<i>I get the feeling that if I give this
to her now, everything will fall apart!</i>

253
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,650
You can have your juice
after you remove my key.

254
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,150
Turn around.

255
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,690
Okay!

256
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,130
Your right hand is a loser.

257
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,300
Why did you put this here?

258
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,840
That wasn't a compliment!

259
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,130
You always act without thinking.

260
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,600
Before you act, please
think a little more.

261
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,640
You aren't listening!

262
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,900
A Little Miracle

you'll find everything.

266
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
Mio.

267
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,940
I'm glad you're here.

268
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,440
What is it, sis?

269
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,490
Something came up.

270
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,780
I was hoping you'd help out the
neighborhood association for me.

271
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,870
What? Ask Mom to help you.

272
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,210
Mom went out to play kick
volleyball with her friends.

273
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,380
And they said they'd pay 10,000 yen.

274
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,210
Thanks.

286
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,740

<i>Everyone that passes
by looks at me with pity.</i>

to attract customers?</i>

<i>This is their mascot, Mr. Rice Cake?</i>

293
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,970
<i>He doesn't have eyes or a
mouth. It's a plain white mask.</i>

294

<i>This isn't Mr. Rice Cake.</i>

295
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,470
<i>It's just a rice cake!</i>

<i>This is a total out.</i>

What is that thing? It's creepy!

301
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,160
Take that!

302
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,960
<i>Stop it. That hurts, so cut it out!</i>

303
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,630

<i>Yukko!</i>

Please don't ruin
the rice cake's image.

313
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,420
I can't watch this.
Come on, take it off.

314
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,710
Geez, part-timers...

315
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,180
Why don't you take care of the store,
instead of just standing there?

<i>I miss being at home.</i>

<i>Are these things even selling?</i>

321
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,790
<i>They're lined up really carefully...</i>

322
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,160
Excuse me.

323
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,950
How much does one cost?

324
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,790
<i>A customer!</i>

325
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,330

<i>How much are we
charging for these?</i>

327
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,540
Excuse me. How much
does one rice cake...

328
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,840
I shouldn't have done this.

329
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,590
I won't run. You
can't make me run.

330
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,930
Uh...

331
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,350
Take one for free.

332
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,020
Lucky me.

333
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,910

The Shinonome household passed
another peaceful day.
