<i>H-how remarkably logical.</i>

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,150
<i>Was my story too unrealistic?</i>

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,570
<i>I must make him believe me!</i>

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,150
Aren't you listening?

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,490
My throat doesn't just hurt. It...

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,910
feels like I'm being strangled.

67
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,670
And sometimes,
I hear strange voices,

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,750
like I'm being possessed!

69
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,960
You know, I think...

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,420
you've just been reading
too many strange books.

71
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,090

way to this temple.</i>

Excuse me...

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,460
<i>He saw right through me!</i>

79
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,880
<i>Of course he did.</i>

80
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,760
<i>I was an idiot to think my bad
acting could fool a professional!</i>

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,930
<i>I have to take this seriously.</i>

82
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,970
<i>To convince him,</i>

83
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,850
<i>I must take it to the limit!</i>

84

85
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,360
Hey! What are you doing?

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,790
What is this?

87
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,160
What are you doing?

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,340
Y-you brat!

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,220

<i>O-oh, no... I've gone too far.</i>

94
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,760
<i>I will explain the
world with science,</i>

95
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,840
<i>and make everyone understand.</i>

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,350
<i>And when the time comes,
I will have but one thing to say...</i>

97
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,350
Are you all right?

98
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,600
Be...

Mihoshi, long time no see.

It's you, Naganohara!

106
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,510
I haven't seen you since before you entered middle school.

107
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,220
That's because you
never come to the dojo.

108
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,850
I haven't been going to
practice at college, either.

109

<i>You damned genius!</i>

112
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,400
Are you going to the dojo?

113
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,030
Yeah, my club just ended.

114
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,620
Are you coming too, Naganohara?

115
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,290
Eh, the more I practice,
the weaker I get.

116
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,790
<i>What are you saying,
you damned genius?</i>

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,210
<i>I have to admit she's strong.</i>

118
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,630
<i>But I can't accept her strength</i>

119
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,760
<i>when she hardly even practices!</i>

120
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,010
<i>I heard that when Naganohara
was in seventh grade,</i>

121
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,430
<i>she scored a point against
the assistant instructor.</i>

122
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,310
<i>Against the assistant instructor!</i>

123
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,560
<i>I'm a middle school student too,
but I don't even stand a chance.</i>

124
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
<i>I go to the dojo after my club,</i>

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,270
<i>and I practice on weekends, too!</i>

126
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,360
<i>The assistant instructor said,
"Hard work will always open doors."</i>

127
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,400
A black cat.

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,330

134
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,640
<i>For now, this is all I can do.
But maybe someday, in a match...</i>

135
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,970
<i>And someday, against
the assistant instructor, too!</i>

155
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,940
I want chocolate
and colored pencils,

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,070
and cake erasers and... and...

157
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,280
You're asking for all that? No fair.

158
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Then, I want two cartons of eggs,
five hundred grams of beef,

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,540
an Ivan Bilibin book, and—

160
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,090
I already asked for lots of stuff,

161
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,380
so you only get one thing!

162
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,800
What?

163
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,970
Nano, um...

164
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,890
You can still ask for a little...

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,870
Trying to run, Tsuyoshi?

174
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,570
Dad!

175
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,200
This time, I made some
modifications to the mask.

176
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Modifications?

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
Underneath that mask, there's...

178
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,290
...wet paint!

179
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,190
Ow, hot!

180
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,110
Crap! I dropped my meat bun!

181
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,190
I didn't even get a single bite...

182
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,070
There, there, Weboshi.

183
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,320
If that bun were
poisoned, you'd be dead.

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,660
See? You're lucky.

185
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,570
I'm not lucky.

186
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,990
This is supposed to be the
best part about walking home.

187
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,040
If you're always positive,

188
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,160
good luck will eventually find you.

189
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,880
You should be grateful
your meat bun fell.

190
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,340
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 95

191
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,880
What's with the optimism?

192
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,840
I've decided to be positive,
no matter what happens.

193
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,850
If you remove the dirty
parts, you can still eat it.

194
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,310
<i>The poison scenario
sure disappeared fast...</i>

195
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,310
If you remove the dirty parts...

196
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,690
Ow!

197
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,320
Ice save!

198
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,320
See? Fortune favors the upbeat.

199
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,070
It's merry magic!

200
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,160
But my meat bun's finished.

201
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,620
Now's the time to look
on the bright side.

202
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,540
If that bun were
poisoned, you'd be dead.

203
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,710
You don't have many
variations, do you?

204
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,300
Even if I cut off the dirty parts,

205
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,300
I don't want the part
with ice cream on it...

206
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,010
Come on. Positive thoughts,
positive thoughts!

207
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,260
Oh no!

208
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,510
The bun's heat must
have weakened it.

209
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,770
If I pretend the ice cream
was poisoned, it's no big deal...

210
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,350
You were just eating it!

211
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,560
What's wrong?

212
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,690
Loser

213
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,530
You used up all your
positive attitude's mojo!

214
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,320
No, God must be warning me not
to eat two and get a stomachache.

215
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh? You're pretty
determined today.

216
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,250
And this ice cream...

217
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,210
If it had been soft serve,
it'd definitely be gone.

218
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,750
But I can wash off the
dirt from this frozen treat.

219
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,670
I'm grateful for that.

220
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,670
You're still going to eat it?

221
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,300
Wait!

222
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,460
How is it?

223
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,460
It looks wet.

224
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,630
Come on, Fet! Positive
thinking, positive thinking!

225
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,640
I give up!

226
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,150
Dash to
Freedom

227
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
If you refuse to
take over my job,

228
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,490
I'll set a second trap,
and then a third.

229
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,500
Dad...

230
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,290
this...

231
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,670
<i>You...</i>

232
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,670
is my...

233
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,000
<i>Impossible!</i>

234
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,890
answer!

235
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,480
Guidance Counselor's Office

236
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,270
Tachibana, what will
you do after graduation?

237
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,190
I'm deciding between
college and culinary school.

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,110
Culinary school, huh?

239
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,330
Wha... wh-wh-wh-what?

240
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,040
Marry him?

241
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,870
Calm down, Tachibana.

242
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,590
You tie it like this, and...

243
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,880
All done.

244
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,510
I'm home!

245
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,850
Oh, Nano, I'm going for
a walk with Sakamoto.

246
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,680
My friends are
coming over to study.

247
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,970
Is that okay?

248
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,560
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 96
Is that okay?

249
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,270
Okay. I wanna hang out
too, so I'll be back soon.

250
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,520
See you later!

251
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,650
Okay!

252
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Hey, what are you doing, kid?

253
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,990
You're killing me!
You're killing me...

254
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,410
Okay! I'll listen!

255
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,580
What do you want? What?

256
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,000
A shark.

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't be ridiculous!

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,210
<i>Crying by myself...</i>

259
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,590
I'm the one who wants to cry!

260
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,840
Okay, a shark?

261
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,260
No problem!

262
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,340
I'll get it right away...

263
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,300
so get this off me!

264
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Dogs...

265
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,730
<i>They're dogs,
so they might bite me.</i>

266
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,400
Sakamoto, dogs.
They might bite us...

267
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,690
Wh-wh-what, y-y-you're scared of dogs?

268
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,610
They're on a leash,
so they can't bite us.

269
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,450
We have to run!

270
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,950
Got it! Let's run!

271
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,870
Sakamoto! We can't run!

272
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,880
Don't give up! If you give up, it's over!

273
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,420
Get the owner to put
them on their leash!

274
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,760
We're done for!

275
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,430
No, no, no... think harder!

276
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,550
What can we do? What can we do?

277
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,180
What to do... what to do...

278
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,680
What to do, what to do...

279
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,390
I had a gummy in my pocket.

280
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,980
That's it! We'll run
while they eat it!

281
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,780
I know! Invent something
that can help us escape!

282
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh, right! I forgot!

283
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,240
Sakamoto...

284
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,660
What?

285
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,530
I don't have the equipment
to make anything!

286
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,450
Damn it!

287
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,540
Boil me or fry me!
Do whatever you want with me!

288
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,920
Boil me...

289
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,960
Fry me...

290
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,000
Do whatever you want...

291
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,970
Dinner.

292
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,510
<i>They're gonna eat us,
they're gonna eat us...</i>

293
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,010
<i>If they get us,
we might be eaten...</i>

294
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,390
Professor?

295
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,600
Why are you crying?
Are you lost?

296
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,650
Yukko!

297
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,570
So this is the professor
you were talking about?

298
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,990
Sakamoto's with you?
Let me pet him...

299
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,280
No, Yukko, you have
to defeat the dogs!

300
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,740
He's unbelievably fluffy!

301
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,870
I'm next!

302
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,370
Don't be ridiculous!

303
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,580
Stop the dogs...

304
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,540
I understand. He bit you,
so you want revenge.

305
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,290
No, he's about to bite us!

306
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,590
What? I bet you're afraid
of dogs, you scaredy cat!

307
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,380
No! He's a dog,
so he'll bite us!

308
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,220
Look at him. This docile
dog wouldn't bite anyone.

309
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,050
He will!

310
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,390
No, he won't.

311
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,100
He will!

312
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,180
Think he'll chew
gum? Just kidding.

313
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,020
He will!

314
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,230
Then watch this.

315
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,900
Shake.

316
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,460
Yukko, are you okay?

317
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,630
If you don't go near him,
he won't bite you.

318
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,590
Yukko... Yukko...

319
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,010
It's okay. Yukko's just stupid, okay?

320
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,850
Okay...

321
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,270
Let's get Yukko and
go to Nano's, okay?

322
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,150
You know Nano?

323
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,100
Of course I—

324
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,770
Where have you been?! You have to keep your dogs on leashes!

325
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,310
Did they play with you?

326
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,770
What are you talking about?!
They almost bit me!

327
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,700
Here.

328
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,990
Shark chocolate!

329
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,450
Thank you very much.

330
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,370
I got some chocolate,
and the dogs are gone.

331
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,920
Isn't that great, Sakamoto?

332
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,340
Only little kids are afraid of dogs.

333
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,590
Hurry up and get this leash off me!

334
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,300
I got some chocolate, so I will.

335
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,970
Huh?

336
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,050
What's wrong?

337
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,180
Sakamoto, take it off. It's too tight.

338
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,220
I would if I could!

339
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,980
Let's get Yukko to do it.

340
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,310
Yukko, untie this.

341
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,230
Hey, Yukko. Hey, Yukko.

342
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,820
Hey.

343
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,110
Is that...

344
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,180
We're home.

345
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,810
There were lots of dogs...

346
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,560
You're so sweaty!

347
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,810
Oh, right! I have some chocolate!

348
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,110
<i>Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate,
chocolate, chocolate.</i>

349
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,740
Aioi and Naganohara sure are late...

350
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,280
<i>Shark chocolate, chocolate, chocolate,
shark, shark, shark chocolate.</i>

351
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,580
They should be over here.

352
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,420
<i>What is this?</i>

353
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,260
<i>There's Buddy...</i>

354
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,340
<i>and another Buddy.</i>

355
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,720
<i>What are they doing?</i>

356
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,850
Gramps!

357
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,850
Humans help each
other out, Takashi.

358
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,440
Animals are the same, Takashi.

359
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,400
Don't underestimate the bond

360
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,820
between animals
and humans, Takashi.

361
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,330
Gramps...

362
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm Kiyoshi.

363
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:29,570
O revered master, what debt I owe you
aogeba toutoshi, waga shi no on

364
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:45,630
How fast the years of learning have passed, here in the garden
oshie no niwa ni mo, haya ikutose

365
00:22:47,760 --> 00:23:03,480
When I pondered, the months and years flew by
omoeba ito toshi, kono toshitsuki

366
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:22,500
Now we must part, so fare thee well
ima koso wakareme, izasaraba

367
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,010
I'm melon bread.

368
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,970
Humans, you spend
an eternity debating

369
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,720
whether melon-flavored
is better or not.

370
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,510
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 23.

371
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,430
Narration:   Shibata Hidekatsu

372
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,230
Don't miss it.
