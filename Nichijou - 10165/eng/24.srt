Wait! Wait!

00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,510

Sis, where's the remote?

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Yesterday, it was

S-sorry.

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,710
Those must be heavy.

70
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,710
Not at all.

71
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,670
Thank you.

Mio! Mio! Big news!

75
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm writing a report. Tell me later.

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,470
Now's not the time for
that! I saw something!

77
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,270
I saw something crazy!

78
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,020
What was it?

79
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,520
Sasahara and Nano
were walking together!

80
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,190
Huh.

81
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,190
<i>Huh?</i>

82
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,490
<i>I expected a bigger reaction.</i>

83
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,740
So?

84
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,290
Uh, yeah...

85
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,300
They seemed to be having
a friendly conversation.

86
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,710
Huh.

87
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,050
Well, I'm sure that sort of
thing happens all the time.

88
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,680
What?

89
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,850
They're people.
Of course they'll talk.

90
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,890
What? Was that all?

91
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,730
Uh, yeah. That's it.

92
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,100
Listen, I have to finish
this report by next period.

93
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,900
I need to focus.

94
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,280
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

95
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>That was boring...</i>

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,820
Well?

97
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,870
Huh?

98
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,540
So... what was it?

99
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,370
What was what?

100
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm asking what they
were talking about.

101
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,590
You there, Yukko?

102
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh, um...

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,590
Sasahara said her
books looked heavy.

104
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,340
And?

105
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,550
That's it.

106
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,020
Yukko, are you stupid?

107
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,360
I always thought you were stupid,

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,280
but I never thought
you were this dumb!

109
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,110
I can't believe you said
you had big news!

110
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,450
Your idiocy must be a
miracle, don't you think?

111
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,370
A miracle moron? Just kidding!

112
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,290
Well, Nano and
Sasahara were kissing.

113
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,600
Th-th-th-there you go again...

114
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,970
After greeting each
other with a kiss,

115
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,190
they went to buy bread together.

116
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,650
Once they finished
their conversation

117
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,480
about the bread they'd
bought, Sasahara...

118
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,940
<i>Sasahara...</i>

119
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,780
... removed his clothes.

120
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,530
<i>Removed his clothes!</i>

121
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,410
Then, motivated by Sasahara
saying "delicious", they...

122
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,410
<i>They...</i>

123
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,410
While in the courtyard...

124
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,620
<i>In the courtyard!</i>

125
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,840
I totally forgot! I have
to do that report, too!

126
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,550
Oh, no...

127
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,090
We have to think
of our own topic...

128
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,300
<i>In the courtyard... In the
courtyard... In the courtyard!</i>

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,520
You bought a fried
noodle sub, didn't you?

130
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,640
But I like it!

131
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,060
You always get that.

132
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,780
Would that make you
the fried noodle princess?

133
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,150
W-well, what did
you get, Koujirou?

134
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,740
Me?

135
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,780
I bought a red bean bun.

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,080
<i>That makes you...</i>

137
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,700
What is it?

138
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Nothing at all!

139
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,250
<i>That makes Koujirou...</i>

140
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,790
<i>the red bean prince!</i>

141
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,050
Delicious.

142
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,010
<i>That makes you...</i>

143
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,760
What is it?

144
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,060
Nothing at all!

145
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,890
<i>That makes Koujirou...</i>

146
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,610
<i>That makes Koujirou
a beautiful man!</i>

147
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,690
Let's eat in the courtyard.

148
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,980
Let's!

149
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,240
And then the teacher
ate a wild whale.

150
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,070
Is that true?

151
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,990
It's true...

152
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,200
If it's true, that would be outside the
200 nautical mile exclusive fishing zone.

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,160
That's not a problem.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,790
That teacher is an Eskimo.

155
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,630
Nano...

156
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,920
You have a bit of
bread on your face.

157
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,480
<i>That delicate moment
floated in on a spring breeze.</i>

158
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,850
<i>Our gentle time together...</i>

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,690

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,440

Rendezvous!

<i>No progress! No progress!</i>

163
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,660
<i>I can't finish my report like this!</i>

164
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,910
Yukko!

165
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,990
I had just thought of a topic!

166
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,120
What did they do
in the courtyard?!

167
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,660
Shut up, already!

168
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,170
Uh, um...

169
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,750
Addis Ababa!

170
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,960
<i>I have to...</i>

171
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,880
<i>I have to go to the courtyard!</i>

172
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,930
<i>I have to enter that
off-color Garden of Eden!</i>

173
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,850
Thank you.

174
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,850
It was nothing.

175
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,850
Farewell.

176
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,230
Huh? Naganohara, what's wrong?

177
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,280
Nano...

178
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,860
Yes?

179
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,780
I heard that you ate a fried noodle
sub with Sasahara in the courtyard.

180
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,530
Sasahara?

181
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,700
Oh, him?

182
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,210
He just picked up my book.

183
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,210
That's all?

184
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,170
Yes. That's all.

185
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,960
Really? No noodle subs?

186
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,050
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,770
Helvetica Standard

188
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:06,810
Aw, come on.

189
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,770
Aw, come on.

190
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,730
Tell me who you like, Yumi.

191
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,320
I don't know...

192
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,070
I promise I won't tell anyone.

193
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,780
If I ever do, I'll give
you one million yen.

194
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,740
Really? Promise, okay?

195
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Okay!

196
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,700
Takashi.

197
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,750
Listen up, everyone!
Yumi likes Takashi!

00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,860
Head!

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,750
Thank you.

203
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,330

<i>That damned genius.</i>

206
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,350
It's rare to see you come to the dojo.

207
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,230
With the tournament coming up,

208
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,270
it's better to practice here,
with an instructor, than at school.

209
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,320
Besides, I'm glad Naganohara came.

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,990
She hasn't been
showing up at all lately.

211
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,070
What? Really?

212
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,910
She says practice makes her weaker.

213
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,700
She's a monster.

214
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,040
Who do you usually
practice with, then?

215
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,910
The instructor, and...

216
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,420
oh yeah, Sasahara's
been stopping by a lot.

217
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,260
Sasahara?!

218
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,970
Why would he come by?

219
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,590
Why?

220
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,970
You've gone to the same
dojo since middle school,

221
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,800
so why wouldn't he come?

222
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,890
Well, yeah, but...

223
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,730
And why didn't
you already know?

224
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,560
Don't you talk at school?
Aren't you in the same club?

225
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,730
No, we're not.

226
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,570
He's been in the acting
club since our first year.

227
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,070
What?!

228
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,400
The acting club?

229
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,450
Why isn't he in the kendo club?

230
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,910
How should I know?

231
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,410
If you subtract kendo from Sasahara,

232
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,000
all that's left is a funny guy.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,460
You're only saying that because
you've only seen him at the dojo.

234
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,630
What does that mean?

235
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,470
Listen, the Sasahara who
joined the school acting club

236
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,800
is out of his mind.

237
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,880
<i>It's grape juice.
is out of his mind.</i>

238
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,010
I can see that...

239
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,350
Right?

240
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,810
But why didn't you invite
Sasahara to join the kendo club?

241
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,680
It's a waste.

242
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,560
What? Why do <i>I</i> have to invite him?

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,810
He can do what he wants.

244
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,030
But Sasahara could
make it to the nationals!

245
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,780
Who cares?

246
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,160
Besides, he's an idiot for joining the acting club without saying a word.

247
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,030
An idiot, an idiot... a huge idiot!

248
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,700
Well, but...

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,870
if you insist,

250
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,620
I guess I could invite him.

251
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,130
<i>She's so easy to read...</i>

252
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,210
Well?

253
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,220
When does Sasahara usually come?

254
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,100
Lately, he's been stopping by about once every three days.

255
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,470
So he'll probably be there tomorrow...

256
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,390
I see... I mean, it's not like I care.

257
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,360
Hey, Sis.

258
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,980
What?

259
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,230
Why don't you confess
your love to Sasahara?

260
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,360
Middle schoolers are too
young to say stuff like that!

261
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,490
I'm going on ahead!

262
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,750
<i>Sis, you're too pure-hearted.</i>

263
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,840
Love-like

264
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,100
It's cold...

265
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,020
Cold attack!

266
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Later!

267
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,160

268
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040

270
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,970
That was delicious.

271
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,470
Thank you for the food!

272
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,560
Professor...

273
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,060
You have to eat your onions, too.

274
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,400
I think I might be a
little young for onions.

275
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,730
What does that mean?

276
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,400
Either way, you need
to finish your food.

277
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,160
But onions are bitter,
so I don't really get them.

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,410
If you don't finish your food,
then starting tomorrow, no snacks for you.

279
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,040
You should follow
Mr. Sakamoto's example.

280
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,370
He always eats...

281
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,790
Sorry. I can't help you...

282
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,630
Mr. Sakamoto, what's wrong?

283
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,470
A-are you okay?

284
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,760
Don't worry. It's just a cold.

285
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,550
A little rest will cure it...

286
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,010
But you haven't eaten anything.

287
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,470
You should have something.

288
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,770
No, I'm fine.

289
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,520
Do you want some milk?

290
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,560
No...

291
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,020
This is a problem.
What can you eat?

292
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,320
No, I don't want
anything right now.

293
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,780
But...

294
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,490
Sakamoto wants to eat onions.

295
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,530
Are you trying to kill me?

296
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,420
Is there anything you want?

297
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,630
No.

298
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,350
I'll leave out some milk.

299
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,810
If you want anything
to eat, just let me know.

300
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,100
I'll go buy it.

301
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,060
Okay.

302
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,530
Since I'm sick, too,
I think I want some chocolate.

303
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,320
Please eat your
onions, Professor.

304
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,900
What?

305
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,490
Why does Sakamoto get
whatever he wants, but I don't?!

306
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,030
Because Mr. Sakamoto is sick.

307
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,740
I'm sick, too!

308
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,250
You're perfectly healthy.

309
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,500
When I'm sick, I want
chocolate! I have a cold, too!

310
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,750
If you have a cold,
you have to take medicine.

311
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,880
Do you want some medicine?

312
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,590
I give up!

313
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,300
Oh, Professor!

314
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,140
Professor...

315
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,300
Go away!

316
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,220
You don't like me, so you're
mean to me about onions!

317
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,690
You like Sakamoto more, so you
don't make Sakamoto eat onions!

318
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,820
That's not it.
Cats can't eat onions.

319
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,940
I've never heard that before!

320
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,110
Oh, well.

321
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,910
I like you more, Professor.

322
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,870
Really?

323
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,250
Yes.

324
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,080
Then, can I have some chocolate?

325
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,670
Let me think...

326
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,920
if you eat your onions, then sure.

327
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,340
What? Why?!

328
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,760
You said you like me more!

329
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,640
Then I like Mr. Sakamoto more.

330
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,600
What? Which is it?

331
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,390
I like you both.

332
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,890
What does that mean?

333
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,940
Sakamoto, what does it mean?

Seven, please.

338
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,320
Thank you.

339
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,570

I haven't been shy this year.

plan for the future is...

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Cartoonist

343
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,380
...to become a cartoonist?

344
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,890
Y-yes.

345
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,600
Naganohara,
you certainly are good at art.

346
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,480
Oh, not really...

347
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I encourage you to
pursue your dreams.

348
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,440
Please do your best.

349
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,500
Let's see... Yukko wants melon juice.

350
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
What should I get?

351
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,500
Well, money's tight this month,

352
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,380
so I'll get plain old banana juice.

353
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,890
Oh, thankâ€”

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,570
You look like a dove
that's been shot.

359
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,490
Oh, s-s-sorry!

360
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,540
<i>Uh, um... what should I do?</i>

361
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
<i>I have to say something.</i>

362
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,710
U-um...

363
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,330
Nice weather we're having.

364
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,000
<i>What am I saying?!</i>

365
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,670
<i>It's super-overcast!</i>

366
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,220
How deep.

367
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,520
Yes.

368
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,810
Does this coin belong to you?

369
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,440
Ah, yes.

370
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,360
I see.

371
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,440
Thank you very much.

372
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,400
Huh? Oh, sure.

373
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,490
What a surprise, for this to happen.

374
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,410
What?

375
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,330
I happened to forget
my wallet today.

376
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,620
I came to this vending machine,
in the hopes of quenching my thirst.

377
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,460
There, I found a coin.

378
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,300
Heaven must have smiled upon me.

379
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,850
This beverage I am
about to consume

380
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,100
is holy water from the heavens.

381
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,360
Um...

382
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,500
This vending machine...

383
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,960
is quite the trickster!

384
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,050
Y-yes!

385
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,300
For this vending machine
to fool me like this...

386
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,430
What an unusually bold
machine it must be.

387
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,980
I like you! I shall give
you a single coin!

388
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,070
S-Sasahara...

389
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,320
<i>I have no proof, but...</i>

390
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,360
<i>I feel like I've gotten
closer to Sasahara.</i>

391
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,330
Mio, where's my melon juice?

392
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,340
Knight

393
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,800
<i>Was she trying to
tell me something?</i>

394
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,470
<i>Naganohara's so strong,
people say she's invincible.</i>

395
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,640
<i>Knight. A knight...</i>

396
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,520
<i>Speaking of knights...</i>

397
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,860
<i>Why don't you confess your love?</i>

398
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Sis, the bath's open.

399
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,670
<i>I wonder if Sasahara's
also looking at this moon.</i>

400
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,630
<i>Sasahara, you're pretty good.</i>

401
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,930
<i>Let's practice together
again sometime.</i>

402
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,930
<i>All right!</i>

403
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,560
<i>Next time, I'll teach
you my finishing move!</i>

404
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,730
Sis!

405
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,730
Look, look, look, look...

406
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,150
Sisters!

407
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,410
Don't come in without permission.

408
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,490
What were you thinking about?

409
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,330
Shut up! Who cares
what I was thinking?

410
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,830
Don't get so embarrassed.

411
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,050
I'm not embarrassed!
Just leave me alone...

412
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,060
In days long past, Ikarus in Greece
mukashi girishia no ikarosu wa

413
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,270
fastened bird feathers with wax
rou de katameta tori no hane

414
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,820
He wore them on his arms and took flight
ryoute ni motte tobidatta

415
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,490
past the clouds and farther yet
kumo yori takaku mada tooku

416
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,700
with only courage on his side
yuuki hitotsu wo tomo ni shite

417
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,170
Steadily the hills draw into the distance
oka wa gungun toozakari

418
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,180
and underneath him stretches out the blue sea
shita ni hirogaru aoi umi

419
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,760
Flapping the wings on his arms
ryoute no hane wo habatakase

420
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,060
he flies towards the sun
taiyou mezashi tondeyuku

421
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,730
with only courage on his side
yuuki hitotsu wo tomo ni shite

422
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,080
We live each day to the fullest
bokura wa tsuyoku ikiteyuku

423
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:50,130
with only courage on our side
yuuki hitotsu wo tomo ni shite

424
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,180
Always out of change when
you have no ten-yen coins.

425
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,390
That's me, the law of
the vending machine.

426
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,480
The next episode of
<i>Nichijou</i> is episode 25.

427
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,520
Narration:     Nagai Ichiro

428
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
Don't miss it.

429
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,480
Narration:     Nagai Ichiro
