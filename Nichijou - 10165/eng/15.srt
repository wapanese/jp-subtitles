00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,310
I bet she's really good at doing math in her head!

00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,560
Who is?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,320
Nano!

Part 59

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,530
She's a robot, so she ought
to have some robot-like functions.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,950
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,410
There's no way she's a robot.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,540
What?

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,410
But she has that key on her back!

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,210
That's the only thing
that makes you think she's a robot?

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,500
That's ridiculous.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,260
No, just think about it.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,340
She's a robot.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,180
It's amazing!

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,300
It's, you know... amazing!

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,600
What? That's not a reason at all.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Which is why I'm thinking
we should find out if she really is a robot.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,520
What?

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,560
Don't do that...

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,020
Don't worry! I've got a plan.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,820

Y-yes?

67
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,990
I have a question.

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,080
What's 3,260 plus 260 divided by 320?

69
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Um, 3,260 plus...

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,550
If it's too hard,

71
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,050
you could use all of your <i>functions</i>.

72
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,220
<i>Wait, Yukko, this is your plan?</i>

73
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,390
I'm sorry...

74
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,600
Then, I'll accept your offer.

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,060
<i>Got her!</i>

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
<i>It's an abacus!</i>

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Um, from the top...

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
<i>She's serious!</i>

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,240
Uh, one, two, three...

80
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,910
<i>Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...</i>

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,870
<i>she's a beginner!</i>

Um, 3,260 plus...

83
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,880
<i>She's not even using the abacus!</i>

84
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,380
Hey, Yukko?

85
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,260
Aioi?

86
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,170
Are you okay?

87
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm fine.

88
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,470
I have a feeling you were right...

89
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,890
Didn't I tell you that she wasn't a robot?

90
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,350
Are you okay?

91
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,890
Do you want something to drink?

92
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,070
<i>Is that...</i>

93
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,740
<i>Could this be...</i>

94
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,570
<i>Could this be...</i>

95
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,120
<i>oil?!</i>

96
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>It's soup!</i>

97
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,790
Yukko?

98
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,880
Uh, um...

99
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,710
Minakami.

100
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,170
Here.

101
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,350
<i>It's a fastball!</i>

102
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,760
<i>Oil?</i>

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,470
Here.

104
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,520
Uh, are you sure?

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,810
Thank you.

106
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,440
<i>She's drinking it!</i>

107
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,940
A swing and a miss!

108
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,070
<i>You can have this, too.</i>

109
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,830
<i>A curveball!</i>

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,620
<i>Monkey wrench!</i>

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,500
Oh, thank you.

112
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,250
You really saved me!

113
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,330
<i>She's eating it!</i>

114
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,830
<i>Another swing and a miss!</i>

115
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Both of you, cut it out, already.

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
You're bothering Nano.

117
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,220
Bonding...

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,930
I just wanted to be friends.

119
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,930
Sheesh...

120
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,940
This isn't the way to do it.

121
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
If anything, it'll make her hate you!

122
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,860
Sorry...

123
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,190
I don't believe you...

124
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,900
Don't worry about it.

125
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,860
What? But...

126
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,530
Oh, I know.

127
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,700
If you don't need this, I'll drink it.

128
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,160
See? You heard her.

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,950
What are you talking about?

130
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,790
<i>Did my tooth come out?</i>

131
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,450
Why don't you put yourself in her shoes?
<i>Did my tooth come out?</i>

132
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,710
Why don't you put yourself in her shoes?

133
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,130
<i>I want to know how someone could create something of such high quality.</i>

134

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
<i>That presence...</i>

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,050
<i>That key.</i>

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,970
<i>She must be a robot...</i>

138
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,270
<i>Who would refrain from
announcing her existence,</i>

139
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,520
<i>and send her to this school instead?</i>

140
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,650
<i>Examine her...</i>

141
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,980
<i>I want to examine her!</i>

142
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,650
<i>And I want to make her mine.</i>

144
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,830
Ms. Nakamura, here are the books you wanted.

145
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,880
<i>She's here! I'll make my move!</i>

146
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,550
Please excuse me.

147
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,300
Shinonome, hold on.

148
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,680
Why not have a cup of coffee?

149
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,350
Huh? Oh, I wouldn't want to trouble you...

150
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,020
Don't be shy. I just made some.

151
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,810
Let me thank you for bringing me those books.

152
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,730
Have a cup.

153
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,520
Then, just one.

154
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,820
<i>First, I'll see if tranquilizers work on her.</i>

155
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,490
<i>If not,</i>

156
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,410
<i>I'll sic my "Mr. Short Circuit"
that I made yesterday on her.</i>

157
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,500
Drink up.

158
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,460
Thank you.

159
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,800
<i>I drank it.</i>

160
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,350
<i>Endure it...</i>

161
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,480
<i>Endure it!</i>

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,740
Please excuse me.

163
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,830
<i>But still, Mr. Short Circuit...</i>

<i>Mr. Short Circuit...</i>

165
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,040
Oh, right.

166
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,290
I heard that Nakamura,
the science teacher, fainted.

167
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,710
Nakamura seems to faint a lot.

168
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,350
<i>Today was a close call...</i>

169
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,060
<i>But Aioi and Minakami</i>

170
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,320

171
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,900
<i>Maybe we could...</i>

172
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Eat this!

This is the Rocket Punch's maximum power!

Professor, Professor!

177
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh, Nano, welcome home.

178
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
Why did you say that twice?

179
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,440
Forget it.

180
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,900
Please remove this...

182
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,780
Why?

183
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,860
"Why"?

184
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,740
Because it's hard to sit in chairs,

185
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,950
and everyone gives me weird looks.

186
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,540
Someone even videotaped me.

187
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,250
But so far, I've managed to fool everyone.

188
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,750
What? But it's cute...

189
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,170
As long as I have this key,

190
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,300
nobody's going to treat me
like an ordinary girl.

191
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,090
I'm sure it'll be popular.

192
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,880
I don't care.

193
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,390
I want to have an ordinary...

194
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,420
Why did you give me this weapon?

195
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,090
I'm just glad this didn't happen at school.

196
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,800
Nano, why don't you want anyone to know you're a robot?

197
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,510
Because it's not cute, of course.

198
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,020
Robots are cute!

199
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
They are not!

200
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,400
They're cute.

201
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,230
Even this gun?

202
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,980
They're cute.

203
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,650
Even the toe USB?

204
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,360
They're cute!

205
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,070
Even the sweet bun in my forehead?

206
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,990
They're cute!

207
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,370
Professor, you're a mad professor!

208
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,580
They're cute!

209
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,920
I want to be more ordinary!

210
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,780
<i>Yay! Fish cake!</i>

211
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,780
<i>Fish cakes are delicious.</i>

212
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,270
Three... Two... One...

213
00:11:52,310 --> 00:12:08,450
It's four o'clock... It's four o'clock...
It's four o'clock... It's four o'clock...

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,300
Hey! We've got rice cakes.
They're cheap.

216
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,470
We've got rice cakes!

217
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,010
Mr. Nakanojo, I can't thank you enough!

218
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Rice cakes shouldn't speak!

219
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,490
I'm sorry, but I...

Part 2
I'm sorry, but I...

221
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,490
I don't just wear this half-heartedly!

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,240
I'm betting my life on thisâ€”

223
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,250
Don't make me say it again!

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,000
<i>Damn it! I made a mistake.</i>

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,500
<i>I knew it was rash to use tranquilizers.</i>

226
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,800
Ms. Nakamura,
Mr. Short Circuit
<i>I knew it was rash to use tranquilizers.</i>

227
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,510
<i>She's a robot.
Ms. Nakamura,
Mr. Short Circuit</i>

228
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:04,680
<i>She's a robot.</i>

229
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,260
<i>It'll take a strong blow to knock her out.</i>

230
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>So, I'll use my currently untested
anti-robot weapon,</i>

231
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,180
<i>Mr. Short Circuit!</i>

232
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,860
<i>I'll use this to knock her out,
and then I'll kidnap her.</i>

233
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,860
<i>It's almost time.</i>

234
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,230
<i>Run!</i>

235
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,400
Ms. Nakamura!

236
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,490
H-hey! Button your shirt up all the way!

237
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,950
Pipe down. I'll do what I want.

238
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,240
No, you won't! I'm the student advisor.

239
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,290
Seriously? How'd you manage that?

240
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,500
How rude! Let me see that.

241
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,460
I'll do it myself. You're embarrassing me!

242
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,960
<i>Uh...</i>

243
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,050
<i>What?</i>

Nichijou:

245
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,850
Makkie, you can't do it yourself.

246
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,560
Aw, shut up...

247
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,060
<i>Makkie?</i>

248
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,930
See?

249
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,480
What're you doing?

250
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,770
Stop it!

251
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,860
Just let me do it.

252
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,320
Here, I'll do it for you.

253
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,360
<i>You? Do it for you?</i>

254
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,860
Jeez...

255
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,410
Don't talk to me so much at school.

256
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,500
Talk to me?

257
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,630
<i>What exactly is your relationship?</i>

258
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,000
It came off again.

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,050
Yeah, perfect. Well, I've got stuff to do.

260
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,170
Hold on!

261
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,010
If you walk around looking disheveled,

262
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,180
people will make fun of you.

263
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,680
So? You always look disheveled at home.

264
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,560
<i>At home!</i>

265
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,140
<i>Dis... Dis... Dis... Dish...</i>

266
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,810
<i>Disheveled!</i>

267
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,690
Disheveled! Great!

268
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,740
<i>No! No! No! What am I, stupid?</i>

269
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,030
<i>How would a china dress
make her look disheveled?</i>

270
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,910
<i>It must be a more ordinary
kind of disheveled!</i>

271
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,070
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

272
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,410
<i>Aren't you embarrassed
to call yourself a teacher?</i>

273
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,120
<i>Disheveled in an ordinary way...</i>

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,660
<i>Ordinary...</i>

275
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,040
<i>Disheveled!</i>

276
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,500
Nice!

277
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,460
Enough, you idiot!

278
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,710
It's fine, I'm going.

279
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,300
What about your button?

280
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,930
This is the Oguri Cap

281
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,650
Stupid!

282
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,910
It's fine, I'm going.

283
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,620
What about your button?

284
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,240
<i>After him...</i>

285
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Mr. Takasaki!

286
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,370
Nakanojo fainted in the science room!

287
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,790
What?!

288
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,460
You have to come right away!

289
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,670
Wait!

290
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,590
Give it up already!

291
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,970
Listen closely.

292
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,760
Okay.

293
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,180
Nakanojo did not faint!

294
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,890
What?!

295
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,690
That's right! He might just be taking a nap!

296
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,860
What?

297
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,980
But his pupils aren't visible!

298
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,320
What?!

299
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,440
Draw them in!

300
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,280
What?

301
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,490
I'll try it.

302
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,700
What?!

303
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Hold on!

304
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,120
What?!

305
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,950
What...

306
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,910
What is the meaning of that?

307
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,880
Immoral sexual activity
requires my attention

308
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
more than an unconscious student,

309
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,000
as a... uh, as a teacher!

310
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,720
That's Ms. Sakurai's younger brother.

311
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,430
Let's go.

312
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,260
Okay.

313
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,140
<i>Here we go...</i>

314
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,850
<i>We should hurry.</i>

315
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,230
<i>After all, I'm a teacher.</i>

316
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,440
It's this way!

317
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,960
Love-like

318
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,310
Take Home

319
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,270
Next stop, Tokisadame Station North Entrance.

320
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,820
Stop requested.

321
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,610
You don't get off at the next stop.

322
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,450
I just felt like pushing the button.

323
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,200
Didn't you just push it earlier?

324
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,040
Someone wanted to get off anyway,
so it worked out.

325
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,330
I see. You were just helping them out.

326
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,330
See? Someone wanted to get off here, too.

327
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,420
Amazing!

328
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,260
Mom, do we have a daily calendar?

329
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,010
Isn't it in the drawer?

330
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,990
Professor, Professor...

331
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,240
Nano, welcome home.

332
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,370
Why won't this key come off?

333
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,750
It really gets in my way at school.

334
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,540
During PE today,

335
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,460
I could only do a belly roll on the high jump!

336
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,750
When we were playing soccer,

337
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,500
I was called offside because of it...

338
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,920
I can take it.

Everyday Life
Part 63

340
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,510
You can take it off?
Why didn't you say so earlier?

341
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,350
Okay. I'll take it now.

342
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,140
Every day of my youth is precious.

343
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,520
Now I can finally live
an ordinary high school life.

344
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,990
Could you take it right now?

345
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,990
Stare...

346
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,700
Professor, are you...
Stare...

347
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,950
I took it.

348
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,910
Again...

349
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,330
Don't make stupid, old puns like that.

350
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,710
Sorry, sorry.

351
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,880
So, does the key come off?

352
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,220
Well...

353
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,100
I don't need any more of your jokes!

354
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,900
Does it come off? Does it?

355
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
It does. It does...

356
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,570
I've taken tons of keys.

357
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,280
Taking yours will be no sweat.

358
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,410
Coin, coin, coin, jump!

359
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,660
You said coin, coin...
you said coin, jump!

360
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,830
Professor! I have a question.

361
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,420
I can't...

362
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,260
I'm laughing so hard, I can't breathe...

363
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,340
Professor,
I've been reacting strangely today.

364
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,810
Did you do something to me?

365
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,480
Yesterday, I gave you
a new reaction function.

366
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,780
Hey! Why would you give me
a function like that?

367
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,530
Why would you do that?

368
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,030
Because it's funny.

369
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,200
Goal!

370
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,210
I'm going to die. I'm going to die...

371
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,580
Isn't it funny?

372
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,040
It's not funny at all!

373
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,050
Professor, we'll deal with the key later.

374
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,920
Please remove this function.

375
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,130
One hundred yen.

376
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,890
Cheapskate!

377
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:01,040
Every once in a while, I wish
toki ni wa naze ka oozora ni

378
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:08,470
To take a journey into the vast sky
tabishitemitaku naru mono sa

379
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:16,520
To get on a balloon and go forth
kikyuu ni notte doko made ikou

380
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:24,530
To ride the wind across the fields
kaze ni notte nohara wo koete

381
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:32,410
I'll soar through the clouds to the ends of the Earth
kumo wo tobikoe doko made mo ikou

382
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:41,750
Because there's something waiting for me
soko ni nani ka ga matteiru kara

383
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,120
Short Thoughts

384
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,880
I'll use all my reserves.

385
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,210
Oil here.

386
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:34,050
My boss tells me I'm slippery,
but I can't help it. I'm oil.

387
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,810
Who is my boss, anyway?

388
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,510
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 16.

389
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,350
Narration:   Sakakibara Yoshiko

390
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,730
Don't miss it.
