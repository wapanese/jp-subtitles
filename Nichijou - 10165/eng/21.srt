It's lunchtime!

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,110
I wasn't expecting that to happen.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,110
It's a miracle!

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,320
I forgot my homework, but I didn't
have to stand in the hallway!

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,660
Luck's on my side today!

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,240
You really should do it.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,750
So, Mio, why not buy me some juice to honor my miracle?

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Aioi,

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,780
I'd like to talk to you
about today's assignment.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,610
Come to the faculty office.

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,280
Okay.

Oh, sorry. You must have
been waiting a while.

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,510
No. I just got here, too.

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,510
I see. That's good.

62
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,100
Are her friends over again?

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,140
There's somewhere I want to go today.

So, how's it coming along?

66
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,270
What do you mean?

67
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,730
What do I mean? Sheesh...

68
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,940
You and Sasahara
are totally in love!

69
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,200
Why do I have to marry him?

70
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,700
I didn't say that...

71
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,450
Why do I have to have a
daughter and then a son?

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,130
Okay, okay! I'm glad you've got your adult life all planned out!

73
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,380
Adult...

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,840
What about you, Weboshi?

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,380
Who, me?

76
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,260
I've got nothing...

77
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,880
What? Come on, tell us.

78
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,930
There's someone you like, right?

79
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,810
Come on. Tell us... tell us...

80
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,640
Fet, sto—

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,770
I give, I give... Christian give...

82
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,610
Nope, I won't stop until you tell me...

83
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,610
Fine, fine! I'll tell,
I'll tell, I'll tell you...

84
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,570
I can't take any more...

85
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,320
If you don't tell me,
I'll tickle you to death!

86
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,620
I said I'd tell you!

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,910
Oh, sorry... I was
having too much fun...

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,670
Who is it? Who do
you like, Weboshi?

89
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,250
I don't know if I really like him.
I'm just sort of interested.

90
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,340
But I'm not sure what his name is.

91
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,470
It's the guy with the mohawk.

92
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,300
Oh...

93
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,760
That guy.

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh, you two know him?

95
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,810
Of course we do.

96
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,930
He's pretty famous
around our school.

97
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,140
With his hairstyle and all.

98
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,350
Weboshi, why'd you
have to like him?

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,860
I'm not sure...

100
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,440
But he's sort of punk, you know?

101
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,200
I prefer kinda wild guys
to good students.

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,870
He's a total bad guy.

103
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,580
I mean, he's got a mohawk!

104
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,790
But the other day,

105
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,000
I heard that punk speaking politely.

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
There you go again!

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
That's ridiculous!
He's got a mohawk!

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,930
But on top of that,

109
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,050
he was watering flowers.

110
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,970
That's surprising.

111
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,270
Oh, and he planted that
thing that looks like Yakult.

112
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,890
What a cute contrast!

113
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,150
And his head looks
like a cut pineapple.

114
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,980
He's so handsome,
he oozes pineapple juice.

115
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,990
That kindness of his is
one of his strong points!

116
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,070
I'd like a kind man, too...

117
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,570
What about you, Fet?
Anyone you like?

118
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,790
Who, me? I—

119
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,700
Sasahara...

120
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,620
<i>Kojirou.</i>

121
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,250
Sasahara fed his
goat on a rainy day.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,420
I get it. Yeah, I get it! That kindness!

123
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,850
What? I didn't say I liked it!

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
So how about you, Fet?

125
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,180
What now?

126
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,810
I'm asking if you like anyone.

127
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,270
I'm not interested in
anyone right now, but...

128
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,440
I don't think I'd be interested
in two weirdos like you.

129
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,700
Begin!

130
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
One point!

131
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,590
Love-like

132
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,430
Ow! Ow, ow...

133
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,510
Hold on.

134
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,510
Here.

135
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,430
Oh, thank you.

136
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,980
Let me see your hand.

137
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,580
<i>And so, I spent my
precious day off</i>

138
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,380
<i>sleeping, eating, and
gardening, just like I always do.</i>

139
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,630
<i>Well, I suppose peaceful
days aren't too bad.</i>

140
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,430
<i>I don't suppose anything
interesting will come my way...</i>

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,430

Mr. Takasaki,
are you shopping too?

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,150
<i>Her hair's tied up!</i>

147
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,490
<i>I've run into her on my day off.</i>

148
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,620
<i>I feel like I've gotten closer to her.</i>

149
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,120
<i>I'm so grateful...</i>

150
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,380
Oh, I'm sorry! Are you in pain?

151
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,800
S-sorry! I was just feeling grateful.

152
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,420
Ms. Sakurai, are you shopping, too?

153
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,890
Yes! The onions were cheap,
so I bought a whole bunch.

154
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,260
Onions, eh?

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,850
I would have brought you
bamboo shoots if you'd asked.

156
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,430
Did you say bamboo shoots?

157
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,690
I have a vegetable garden at home.

158
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,060
<i>It's, you know...
I have a vegetable garden at home.</i>

159
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,190
You do? That's amazing.

160

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,530
<i>makes me feel this must be fate.</i>

162
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,530
<i>Like we're bound by
fate, or something.</i>

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,250
<i>Is the coincidence
causing these emotions?</i>

164
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,830
<i>I'm honestly surprised...</i>

165
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,750
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

166
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,210
<i>I want to be an onion.</i>

167
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,590
Are you all right?
You seem to be in pain...

168
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,340
Shall we rest somewhere?

169
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,220
I-I'm sorry! I'm totally fine!

170
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,970

Thinking about...

173
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,480
<i>Shall we rest somewhere?</i>

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,150
Think...

175
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,690
<i>Shall we rest somewhere?</i>

176
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,320
<i>Shall we rest somewhere?</i>

177
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,820
<i>That would be more than enough...</i>

178
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,740
Come! Come along!

179
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,580
Ms. Sakurai, there's a park
over there we can go to!

180
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,370
Okay.

181
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,250
<i>I never thought
this would happen.</i>

182
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,090
<i>This isn't a date, isn't it?!</i>

183
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,970
<i>Aioi?</i>

184
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,850
M-M-Ms. Sakurai! Let's try
that field over there...

185
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,890
<i>What is Aioi doing here?</i>

186
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,350
<i>If people find out about this...</i>

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,020
What are you two doing?

188
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,400
You idiot! This is,
you know, that...

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,110
That thing!

190
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,990
Hello.

191
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,990
I didn't know you
two were dating.

192
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,580
You idiot! Don't
mock your teachers!

193
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,040
What? But you seem
happy together...

194
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,080
You little brat.

196
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,340
Ms. Sakurai, good morning.

A
Mr.
Takasaki

198
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,550
Hey, you lovebirds!

199
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,970
It's getting hot in here!

200
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,930
Idiots! Don't make fun of us!

201
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,440
Jeez! Those brats...

202
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,230
I seem to have caused
you some trouble.

204
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,070
Oh, but...

205
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,240
I am a little happy.

206
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,950
Good enough!

207
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,990
<i>Am I stupid?</i>

208
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,910
<i>There's no way that would happen!</i>

209
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
I have to get out of here!

210
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,920
That came out of nowhere.

211
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,920
Oh, no!

212
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,130
What are you doing, Mr. Takasaki?

213
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,930
What's this? Why, if it isn't Ms. Sakurai!

214
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,350
And Aioi! Why, if it isn't Aioi!

215
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,680
You have to keep an eyes peeled,
or you don't even notice these things.

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,520
Aioi? You're Aioi, right?

217
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,310
I'm Aioi! Just kidding.

218
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,520
Well, there you have it.

219
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,780
I've got something to do,
so I'll see you later.

220
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,830
<i>I guess...</i>

221
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,500
<i>I'll go buy some
onions, and go home.</i>

222
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,130
Sorry for calling you out here.

224
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,300

226
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,470
Yes, but I had a strange dream.

227
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,470
A strange dream?

228
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,900
Well, I dreamed we kissed here.

229
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,230
I'll make that dream a reality.

230
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,900
What? Are you serious?

231
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,740
P-Professor, would you like some snacks?

232
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,570
Do you really love me?

233
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,320
Don't be silly.

234
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,180
<i>After a month-long investigation,</i>

235
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,180
<i>I've learned that she visits this
supermarket at this time every Saturday.</i>

236
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,720
<i>It's almost time for her to arrive.</i>

247

<i>Why haven't you
come, Shinonome?</i>

248
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,580
<i>Does this mean you don't
always go to the supermarket?</i>

249
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,340
<i>I've already waited this long.</i>

250
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,260
<i>If I leave now, I might miss her.</i>

251
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,380
Huh?

252
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,300
Ah, it's you, Ms. Nakamura.

253
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,220
Hello.

254
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,810
<i>It's the Japanese teacher
with the sideburns!</i>

255
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,520
H-hello.

256
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,440
I almost didn't recognize
you without your lab coat.

257
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,020
<i>Why did I have to
run into him now?</i>

258
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,610
<i>If you don't need anything, just go.</i>

259
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,400
<i>If Shinonome arrives now...</i>

260
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,530
Your casual clothes are
rather boyish, aren't they?

261
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,490
It's kind of cute.

262
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,120
No, I wouldn't say that...

263
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,830
No, the contrast between those
clothes and your normal lab coat

264
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,500
is sort of innocent and cute.

265
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,590
<i>I'll have to retreat for today!</i>

266
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,630
Huh? Ms. Nakamura?

267
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,560
Um, Minakami, have you thought about
what you'd like to do in the future?

268
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,900
Yes.

269
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,360
Are you planning to work?

270
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,320
Uh, do you plan on further schooling?

271
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,790
Um...

272
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,290
I understand.

274
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,930
Did you find it?

275
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,350
Where is it?

276
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,060
I can't find the wood cube...

277
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,820
How does something
disappear from a locked safe?

278
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,650
We get paid if we find it,
so I'm happy about that.

279
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,280
I heard the officer just found one.

280
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,120
There's only one left?
I'll have to look harder.

281
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,420
<i>I wonder if finding it would earn me any points with the throne.</i>

282
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,380
H-hey, look there.

283
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,600
Give me back the wood cube.

284
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,520
What are you talking about, miss?

285
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,770
How'd you get in here?

286
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,190
Are you a stowaway?

287
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,280
The punishment for
that's quite severe.

288
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,410
You'll either be thrown in
prison for at least ten years...

289
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,660
Or you'll have tea
with me. Just kidding.

290
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,290
Twenty-two!

291
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,580
What are you doing...

292
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,830
Wait.

293
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,080
Hold your horses!

294
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,670
It's all right. I just
let down my guard.

295
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,670
Leave this to me.

296
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,300
You think you're a tough
little girl, don't you?

297
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,430
Don't you think this
game's gone too far...

298
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,440
Are you okay?!

299
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,440
He's dead...

300
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,020
That bitch!

301
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,110
The stowaway's
after the wood cube?

302
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,860
Surround her! We'll trap her!

303
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,820
Quiet, everyone.

304
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,780
There is no reason to panic.

305
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Officer!

Fey Kingdom Military Staff Officer
AKA The Resilient Negotiator

307
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,290
Leave this to me.

308
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,960
<i>I'm sure the officer will
do something about this.</i>

309
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,510
<i>She entered alone,
in pursuit of the wood cube.</i>

310
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,890
<i>She must be a spy.</i>

311
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,350
<i>However, if we could
harness her strength,</i>

312
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,890
<i>it might prove to be a great
weapon for our country.</i>

313
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,270
<i>Fortunately, I have
one wood cube here.</i>

314
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,940
<i>If this is what she wants,</i>

315
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,650
<i>I'm sure the right offer
will buy her allegiance.</i>

316
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,650
This is the wood cube you desire.

317
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,660
Why don't we make a deal?

318
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,620
Ow!

319
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,880
Officer!

320
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,050
He's dead...

321
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,090
This isn't good.

322
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,670
That bitch...
She killed the officer!

323
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,220
You monster! We'll
never let you go alive!

324
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,100
This isn't good! This isn't good...

325
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,850
This is very bad...

328
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,100
What's wrong, Scholar?

329
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,110
What's so bad?!

330
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,650
This is a serious matter.

331
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,280
She already had one wood cube,

332
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,200
and now she has the one
she just put in her hair.

333
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
That's the other wood cube!

334
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,500
She has both wood cubes!

335
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,250
What? Even with both,

336
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,000
if she doesn't know how to
summon the ancient weapon...

337
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,340
That's right! We can still do something—

338
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,090
Shut up!

339
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,710
According to this magic encyclopedia,

340
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,510
one possessing both wood cubes
gains the ancient weapon's power...

341
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,510
In other words,
she has the wood cubes.

342
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,350
So, she has the ancient weapon's power...

343
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,640
What did you say?

344
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,940
Explain it again!

345
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,270
Yeah, explain it again!

346
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,110
In other words...

347
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,820
There's nothing else to say!

348
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,490
It's foolish to approach her!

349
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,070
She'll destroy the world!

350
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,580
We're done for...

351
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,000
We're done for...
We're done for...

352
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,620
Don't panic!

353
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:47,790
Nothing comes of panic!

354
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,000
Fey Kingdom Captain
AKA Nothing Special
Nothing comes of panic!

355
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,630
Captain...

356
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,550
Captain!

357
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,930
If we attack from the
front, we're done for.

358
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,180
We cannot win.

359
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,770
However! There's only one of her!

360
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,810
In contrast, we are many!

361
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,440
We need only to attack together!

362
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,650
I'll lead the charge!

363
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,610
Follow me!

364
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,410
Captain!

365
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,040
Don't worry about me. Go!

366
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,540
B-but...

367
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,960
You fool,

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,080
I didn't teach you to be pansies!

369
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,090
<i>We're finished.</i>

370
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,060
<i>The officer's dead,
and the captain can't move.</i>

371
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,930
<i>There's nothing we can do!</i>

372
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,930
One...

373
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,350
One for all...

374
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,360
And all...

375
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,980
for one!

376
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,420
Captain!

377
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,430
<i>It's been twelve years
since I joined this troop.</i>

378
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,850
<i>I won't let twelve years' worth
of memories end like this.</i>

379
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,230
<i>Not with this monster.</i>

380
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,730
<i>Not here...</i>

381
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,980
<i>I won't...</i>

382
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,370
<i>let it end here!</i>

383
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,090
We're finished.

384
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,430
I don't want to die!

385
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,460
I'll go wash my face.

386
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,470
Short Thoughts

387
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,340
<i>So obvious!</i>

388
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,300
Don't be surprised, okay?
Jack-in-the-Box
<i>So obvious!</i>

389
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,760
<i>Good grief...</i>

390
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,060
<i>Well, I don't have
anything else to do.</i>

391
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,230
<i>I might as well
play with the kid...</i>

392
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,940
Even when wasting time,

393
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,780
talent is still talent.

394
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,070
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 92

395
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,830
<i>Your hair's sticking up. How cute.</i>

396
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,540
<i>It's kind of cute.</i>

397
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,310
What am I doing?!

398
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Sunday Night

399
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,060
I'm finished.
The water felt great...
Sunday Night

400
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,860
I'm finished.
The water felt great...

401
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:24,070
The colors of the flowers, the shadows of the clouds
hana no iro kumo no kage

402
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:33,410
are memories that take me back to my childhood
natsukashii ano omoide

403
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:42,790
Today I leave you all behind windows of yesteryear
sugi shi hi no mado ni nokoshite

404
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:52,220
to spread my wings and walk the world
sudachiyuku kyou no wakare

405
00:22:52,850 --> 00:23:01,730
Goodbye, goodbye, my teachers
izasaraba saraba sensei

406
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:10,910
Goodbye, goodbye, my friends
izasaraba saraba tomo yo

407
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:22,420
May we see a bright tomorrow
utsukushii asu no hi no tame

408
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,050
I'm the lovers' umbrella.

409
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,470
Why don't you try
drawing me again?

410
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,180
Write your own name
on the right, and...

411
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,970
You don't have a name
to write on the left?

412
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,470
For all you lonely
viewers out there...

Narration:      Shimamoto Sumi
