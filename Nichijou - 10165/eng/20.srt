Mr. Sakamoto...

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,090
Mr. Sakamoto...

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,720

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,470
H-h-h-hey... stop. Stop, stop!

00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,430
Mr. Sakamoto.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,050
H-h-h-hey... stop. Stop, stop!

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,010
Just calm down, already!

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,020
First, tell me why
you're doing this!

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,810
The best, friendship, perfect harmony!

Mai, add some tones here.

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,990
And Yukko, use the pencil to write the page numbers here.

59
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,030
Fill in the hair, too.

60
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,910
Okay.

61
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,120
Amazing!

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,660
Naganohara, I didn't
know you drew manga.

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,120
Oh, it's no a big deal.

64
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,250
She used to hide it from
us and draw in secret.

65
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,220
Who cares about the past?

66
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,220
Really?

67
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,130
Yeah.

68
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,310
But when I sent my
last submission in,

69
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,640
I got a letter that said they were looking forward to my next one.

70
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,980
It made me think it was a bit weird to keep my drawing a secret.

71
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,940
They must think you have talent!

72
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,320
That can't be true...

73
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,320
Could I take a look?

74
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,410
U-um, Nano?

75
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,040
Sorry, sorry.

76
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,210
Nano, you don't need to read it.

77
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,800
Nano!

78
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,170
E-excuse me. I'm going outside for a bit...

79
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,590
Are you okay? Want me to come?

80
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,220
No, it's fine.

81
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,930
You came to help
Naganohara with her work.

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,980
I'll be back soon...

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,020
Nano has a lot on her plate.

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,780
Shoot! It's getting late!

85
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,860
We don't have any time to waste...

86
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,240
Let's keep working until Nano gets back.

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,870
The deadline's tomorrow.

88
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,200
Roger that!

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,580
I'm not a bad artist myself.
Let's wrap this up.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,170
All units, attack! Just kidding.

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,570
Nichijou:

92
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,530
Yukko, don't give up so soon.

93
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,280
Here.

94
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,540
That was quick...

95
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,660
Let's look over your work.

96
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,330
Don't make me hit you.

97
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,170
Don't...

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,170
Hold it, Mai! What are you drawing?!

99
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,250
Saint Kuuya.

100
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,470
That's not what I meant!

101
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,880
Why are you drawing at all?

102
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,510
I heard the empty background crying.

103
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,640
What?

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Erase that with White-Out!

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,480
Just put the tone there...
and don't do anything weird!

106
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,400
This has to be the worst pain
I've ever experienced.

107
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,150
I guess I'll fill in the hair.

108
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,660
Huh?

109
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,750
Um...

110
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,830
<i>Huh?</i>

111
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,170
<i>Wait wait wait wait!</i>

112
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,420
<i>What? This... What? What?</i>

113
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,510
Oh, right. If you make a
mistake, tell me right away.

114
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,760
<i>Right away?</i>

115
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,230
<i>I can't do that! I have to
fix this as soon as possible!</i>

116
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,390
Here.

117
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,100
You're done?

118
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,900
I hope you didn't draw
anything this time.

119
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,110
Don't make me kill you.

120
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,190
Don't...

121
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,280
Do...

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,150
...n't make me kill you?

123
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,450
What is this?

124
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,240
A graveyard.

125
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,530
You idiot!

126
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,000
This is a fancy palace in Daikanyama!

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,080
And I told you not to draw anything...

128
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,330
Why would you do this?

129
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,750
Because there was space there.

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,300
I can't handle this!

131
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,970
Forget it. Just erase it.

132
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,600
Just erase it, okay? Just erase!

133
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
Okay.

134
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,910
<i>L-looks pretty good...</i>

135
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,330
<i>It looks pretty good, but it just...</i>

136
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,830
<i>doesn't look right!</i>

137
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,950
<i>Would it fan the flames
to show her this?</i>

138
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,410
I'm done.

139
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,500
Did you erase it properly this time?

140
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,210
I really need you to
stop messing around.

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,130
Why?

142
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,550
What is this?!

143
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,180
I erased it.

144
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,430
Do you want me to erase you?!

145
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,390
Why would you do this?

146
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,600
Because this comic
isn't very interesting.

147
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,640
You just hit a nerve!

148
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,070
I'll give you a new sheet, so draw in
panel borders. Just like that page...

149
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,980
Okay.

150
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,990
Just the borders, okay?!

151
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,660
Helvetica
Standard

152
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,120
10 seconds.

153
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,710
20 seconds.

154
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,670
1, 2, 3,

155
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,680
4, 5, 6, 7,

156
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,680
8, 9, 10.

157
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,270
Time.

158
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,070
<i>This... this is out of control!</i>

159
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,280
<i>It's not even about
looking similar any more.</i>

160
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,870
<i>Who the heck is this?!</i>

161
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,370
<i>Showing this to her will
definitely fan the flames!</i>

162
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,660
I'm done.

163
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,550
You really just drew in panel borders?

164
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,180
Once upon a time, there was
an old man and an old woman.

165
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,800
The old man went to cut
grass in the mountains...

166
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,900
It's a private born from a peach.

167
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,070
I don't care about that!

168
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,870
Mai, just read a book...

169
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,870
Okay.

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,550
<i>Th-this...</i>

171
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,050
<i>is hopeless!</i>

172
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,060
<i>I feel like the more I
panic, the worse it gets...</i>

173
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,350
<i>Aw crap. What am I
gonna do? What </i>can<i> I do?</i>

174
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,780
Mai!

175
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,400
Leave it to me.

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,240
<i>C-can she really
do it? Can you, Mai?</i>

177
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,040
<i>Of course not... there's just no way...</i>

178
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,090
<i>What? Mai!</i>

179
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,010
<i>So good! Unbelievably good!</i>

180
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,180
<i>She's too good! But this...</i>

181
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,310
<i>This is unbelievably different!</i>

182
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,440
<i>I want to go back to the time...</i>

183
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,570
<i>before I knew right from left.</i>

184
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,450
<i>When everything seemed so new...</i>

185
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,830
<i>And I'll tell myself...</i>

186
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,330
<i>to stay like that.</i>

187
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,670
I'm sorry!

188
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,170
Please draw this again!

189
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,720
But...

190
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,050
I don't have any more paper!

191
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,980
Morals

192
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,410
Um, don't run in the hallway...

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,030
Sasahara!

194
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,170
Short Thoughts

195
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,800
That brat-

196
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,430
I can't get this thing off!

197
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,970
There wasn't any point.

198

Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 84

199
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,460
You're open!

200
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,290
Naganohara?
What are you doing here?

201
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,420
No, no, no. Me, too!

202
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,720
Oh...

203
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,180
What are you doing?

204
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,510
Oh, um... nothing much.

205
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,010
I see...

206
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,940
Actually, I just couldn't focus during practice,
even with the meet coming up.

207
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,150
When you were in high school,
did you ever feel this way?

208
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,950
For some reason,
my armor feels really heavy.

209
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,660
<i>She's not listening...</i>

210
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>Shiitake Zanmai</i>'s
a weird comic, isn't it?

211
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,540
She can't do anything but kendo.

212
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,630
Huh? What? Did you hear
something interesting?

213
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,750
Forget it.

214
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,470
Naganohara, isn't the
national meet coming up?

215
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,470
That's true.

216
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,850
Right? Mihoshi said you
hadn't been by the dojo...

217
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,430
I came to shop!

218
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,060
Huh? But...

219
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,520
Have some crackers.

220
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,190
Huh? What?

221
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,820
Later!

222
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,990
What was that about?

223
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,370
Hey, Sis!

224
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,290
What are you doing here?

225
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,380
Naganohara was just here.

226
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,250
What? Isn't she going to the
national meet tomorrow?

227
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,260
What? It's tomorrow?

228
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,670
Did she say anything?

229
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,090
Not really.

230
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,850
Oh! She left these.

231
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,180
Do you want one?

232
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,140
Okay.

233
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,140
Whoah, they're really red.

234
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,890
They are...

235
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,990
Hot!

236
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,490
Melon Bread

237
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,160
Melon Bread
Best before date located
on back of bread.

238
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,170
Expiration

239
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,760
Love-like

240
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,140
Hey, Mio... check this out.

241
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,430
How does this look?

242
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,730
I thought it might be
fun to change my image.

243
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,480
Does it look good?

244
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,440
Yeah, it suits you.

245
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,230
Ready?

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,650

247
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,700
Not yet.

250
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,490
Ready!

251
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,380
Okay, here I come!

252
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,500
Professor, where are you?

253
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,890
Ready.

254
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,470
Mr. Sakamoto, found you!

255
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,650
Luck's a scary thing.

256
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,110
I don't usually play
kiddy games like this.

258
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,860
But I guess I should play with
you guys every once in a while.

259
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,280
I see.

260
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,370
What are you doing?

261
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,950
Huh?

262
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,790
Let's get going!

263
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,960
Yes!

264
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,350
Professor...

265
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,310
Where are you?

266
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,480
Hey, kid!

267
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,350
Professor?

268
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,310
Where is that kid hiding?

269
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,230
We can't find her anywhere.

270
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,490
They'll never find me here.

271
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,660
That kid could be hiding outside.

272
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,870
You're right. Why
don't we take a break?

273
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,540
Sure. But, you know...

274
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,670
What if we never found her?

275
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,670
Professor...

276
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,090
Did you make this yourself?

277
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,140
Why did you come out?

278
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,230
That's not how you play
hide-and-seek, you know.

279
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,650
I thought you wouldn't
be able to find me...

280
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,360
<i>Well, we couldn't.</i>

281
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,860
Professor...

282
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,700
Did you just blow your nose?

283
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,240
Yeah.

284
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Professor, now there's more to wash...

285
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,460
You really are hopeless.

286
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm "it" this time! Let's play!

287
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,590
Then I'll wash it.

288
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,720
You'd probably mess it up, so it's okay.

289
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,640
I wouldn't mess it up.

290
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,060
No, I'm sure you'd mess it up.

291
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,600
I can do it...

292
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,820
This is Pyon!

293
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,660
What did you say?

294
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,830
No, but...

295
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,490
No buts!

296
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,460
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 86

297
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,630
I'm glad you want to help.

298
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,260
But you were the one
who spilled the ink, right?

299
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,930
I didn't have any more paper.

300
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,100
So, when I was forced
to ask you to get some,

301
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,890
what did you say?

302
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,270
What was it you said?

303
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,690
<i>Which of us should go buy it?</i>

304
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,570
<i>I'll let...</i>

305
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,480
<i>...this decide.</i>

306
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,780
That's ridiculous!

307
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,160
You spilled the ink,
so you go buy it!

308
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,620
I still have lots of work to do!

309
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,500
But that's fine.

310
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,630
Once you ended up going
to buy it, what did you say?

311
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,420
Hold on...

312
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,540
What did you say?!

313
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,510
<i>Hey, how old do I look?</i>

314
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,970
Who cares?

315
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,050
If you don't hurry, the
stationery store will close!

316
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,060
Why are you asking me this now?

317
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,220
You look your age!

318
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,810
But that's fine.

319
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,190
So, you were going to the store.

320
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,060
And when you put on
your shoes, you said...

321
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,020
<i>It's cold today...</i>

322
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,110
<i>Oh, I feel a little under the weather.</i>

323
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,360
Just suck it up!

324
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,320
How long are you gonna drag this out?

325
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,700
And it's not cold today, either!

326
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,820
But that's still fine!

327
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,700
And you ended up buying...

328
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,290
What <i>is</i> that?!

329
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,040
I asked you for paper!
Yeah, but...

330
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,870
I asked you for paper!

331
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,040
When I told you to stop with
the jokes, you gave me...

332
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,090
<i>Here.</i>

333
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,460
No, thank you!

334
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,300
I can't use that!

335
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,380
What do you expect
me to do with it?

336
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,600
When I said that, you said...

337
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,060
<i>Forgive me, hyacinth.</i>

338
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,810
Hyacinth!

339
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,440
This isn't some minor problem!

340
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,900
And where'd the hyacinth
come from, anyway?

341
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
But I still believed in you.
I believed that you bought me paper...

342
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,530
That's a hard gag!

343
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,410
But when I asked you for
the paper, what did you say?

344
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,030
<i>Mio, you need to
pacifyacinth yourself.</i>

345
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,580
Pacifyacinth!

346
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,120
Who needs to pacify herself?
Who needs a hyacinth?

347
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, that's why...

348
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,290
I asked you again if
you actually bought it...

349
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,960
And what did you say then?!

350
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,880
<i>Forgive me.</i>

351
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,090
What happened to the hyacinth?!

352
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,510
Who cares about hyacinths, anyway?

353
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,680
The paper!

354
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,640
And you gave me...

355
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,350
<i>Here.</i>

356
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,020
<i>Yes, yes, yes, perfect...</i>

357
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,980
<i>Time to write...</i>

358
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,610
You idiot!

359
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,610
How much stupidity do you have to put me through before you're satisfied?

360
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,650
When I asked you what
you were trying to do...

361
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,280
<i>Did you know that the
truth isn't always correct?</i>

362
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Yes, it is!

363
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,290
You were completely useless,
so I tried to ask Nano for help!

364
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,580
I asked her to buy paper for me, and...

365
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,920
She was totally spaced out!

366
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,710
Her eyes were glued to
the page! It was a cry of joy!

367
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,010
I had no choice, so I asked Mai...

368
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,760
<i>Mai, could you go and buy it for me?</i>

369
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,970
A
home.
going
I'm

370
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,220
She went home!

371
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,270
She left without making a sound!

372
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,850
Mai always does
everything her own way...

373
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,900
It's Mai's way or the highway!

374
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,730
When you saw the letter, do you
remember what you said?

375
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,820
<i>It must be a divine trick.</i>

376
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,160
<i>Some kind of devilish trap.</i>

377
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
This is a devilish trap!

378
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,830
It's been a devilish trap
since you guys arrived!

379
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,580
When I said that, you...

380
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,500
I don't get it!

381
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,460
Well...

382
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,170
Stop it!

383
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,880
I don't want to hear
your excuses, you moron!

384
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,840
No, no, no. That's why...

385
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,090
I don't have any more peanuts, you...

386
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,680
Peanut-head!

387
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,600
But this...

388
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,940
There you go again!

389
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,690
What...

390
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,700
F-forgive me, hyacinth...

391
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:06,840
Let's relive our wonderful love
ano subarashii ai wo mou ichido

392
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:29,240
Ever since the day I pledged my life away
inochi kakete to chikatta hi kara

393
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:39,080
although wonderful memories remain
suteki na omoide nokoshite kita noni

394
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,500
we, who back then saw the same flower
ano toki onaji hana wo mite

395
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,300
both as something beautiful
utsukushii to itta futari no

396
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:59,100
no longer speak to each other's hearts
kokoro to kokoro ga ima wa mou kayowanai

397
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:08,280
Let's relive our wonderful love
ano subarashii ai wo mou ichido

398
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:20,830
Let's relive our wonderful love
ano subarashii ai wo mou ichido

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,010
