Halloween was last week...

172
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,670
This is a Crow!

173
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,320
If you must pass a crow that's
attempting to intimidate you,

174
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,700
make sure you maintain eye contact.

175
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,490
Sleep

176
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm not that sleepy...

177
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,170
They say counting sheep jumping
over a fence will help you sleep.

178
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,010
Okay! I'll try it!

179
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,180
One sheep...

180
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,840
<i>She's out after the first one!</i>

181
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,720
<i>Professor, that's amazing! I'll try, too!</i>

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,850
<i>One...</i>

183
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,060
That sheep didn't make it over the fence...

184
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,360
Volunteer
Spirit

185
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,650
There you go.

186
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,200
Thanks, Sis. You're amazing.

187
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,410
Did Sasahara teach
you how to do this?

188
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,710
Wh-why would he have
taught me everything?

189
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,380
Aren't you two good friends?

190
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,710
No! Not at all! Really, not at all!

191
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,380
Calm down...

192
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,510
Didn't you iron a handkerchief recently?

193
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,220
That was just some trash I happened
to come across in the street...

194
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,060
You didn't iron it
because it was Sasahara's?

195
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,770
I-I told you that wasn't why!

196
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,270
I was working out my arms,

197
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,730
and an iron happened to be there.

198
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,960
And a handkerchief
happened to be under that...

199
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,140
Or something...

200
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,530
something like that!

201
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,700
<i>It's so obvious...</i>

202
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,410
But you looked so happy
when you were ironing.

203
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,290
D-don't be stupid!

204
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,130
I... it was...

205
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,050
The Earth had just
entered the Photon Belt!

206
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,980
So, yesterday...

207
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
What happened?

208
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,860
I talked to Ono.

209
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,360
What? That's great!

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,700
<i>Two hours by train,
then one hour by bus.</i>

211
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,000
<i>I left the bustle of the city</i>

212
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,090
<i>for the countryside Town S.</i>

213
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,770
<i>While believing I'd never
find it, but unable to give up,</i>

214
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,690
<i>I've been searching for a single book.</i>

215
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,690
<i>That phantasmal book</i>

216
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,120
<i>that brought color into
my gray childhood...</i>

217
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,410
<i>Because I entered this library...</i>

218
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,130
<i>I can read that book again.</i>

219
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,100
<i>I thanked those who helped me,</i>

220
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,350
<i>and took the book in my hands.</i>

221
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,690
Autumn

222
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,520
<i>Trying to calm my pounding heart...</i>

223
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,440
<i>I...</i>

224
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,700
<i>slowly opened the book.</i>

225
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,160
Love-like

226
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,380
Time's almost up.

227
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,920
Remember to sign your names.

228
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,420
Ten, nine, eight...

229
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
seven...

230
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,140
six... five...

231
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,600
four... three...

232
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,100
two...

233
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,940
one...

234
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,940
Zero!

235
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,950
Please pass your papers to the front!

Nichijou:

237
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,340
Halloween ended a while ago...

238
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,150
This coffee isn't very coffee coffee!

239
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,780
Huh? Not coffee coffee?

240
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,860
What does that mean?

241
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,860
I don't really get it, either.

242
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,410
But... it's just not coffee coffee!

243
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,330
Just try it! Here.

244
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,080
What does "not coffee coffee" even mean?

245
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,250
<i>It's not coffee coffee!</i>

246
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,590
Everyone, it's finally finished!

247
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,810
Nichijou:

Everyone, it's finally finished!

248
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,770
It's Biscuit #2.

249
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,060
I am Biscuit #2.

250
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,350
Oh, that thing from the other day...

251
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,730
<i>Hardly any reaction.</i>

252
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,490
Hey, I want you to look at it...

253
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,200
But I already saw the other one.

254
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,820
#1 and #2 are different!

255
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,950
This one's even more amazing!

256
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,540
I see...

257
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,830
<i>My name is Biscuit #2.</i>

258
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,460
<i>I am a Biscuit Robot
made by Professor Shinonome.</i>

259
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,710
<i>True to my name, biscuits
are my power source.</i>

260
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,920
<i>I run on biscuits...</i>

261
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,930
Professor, my biscuit!

262
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,470
What? This is the last one...

263
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Biscuit #2's specialty is speed reading!

264
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Go ahead.

265
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,030
Done.

266
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,860
Yes!

267
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,910
Why aren't you surprised?

268
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,700
Well, I can read fast, too...

269
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,540
Then why do you
always read so slowly?

270
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,130
I think this way seems
a bit more normal...

271
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,710
What's wrong, Biscuit #2?

272
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,130
Books with lots of
words make me sleepy.

273
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,180
That sounds pretty normal to me.

274
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,730
Why won't you tell me I'm awesome?

275
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm super awesome!

276
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,110
Is that what you're upset about?

277
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,980
It's important...

278
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,190
You're already awesome, Professor.

279
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,200
That's right.

280
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,450
I may have made a slight mistake.

281
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,200
I don't think you made a mistake...

282
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Hey, how awesome am I?

283
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,540
Uh, about as awesome as
the Chichibu Mountain Range.

284
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,750
I don't get it...

285
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,590
Then, you're as awesome
as the Nullarbor Plain.

286
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,960
I want something bigger!

287
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,260
Like a whale?

288
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,050
That might work.

289
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,680
Whales are certainly large.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,970
They really are...

291
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,270
Short Thoughts

292
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,150
There is no "that's fine."

293
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,940
There is no "this is fine."

294
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,610
And that's just fine.

295
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,460
What are you going to do?

296
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,290
Snakes and Ladders!

297
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,000
What'll you do?

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,290
A quiz!

299
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,460
Quizzes are fun for everyone.

300
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,840
But getting paid to entertain the princess

301
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,720
seems like a lot of fun...

302
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,300
You've got to have fun
like this once in a while.

303
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,470
Yeah.

304
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,640
I just put the ball in here...

305
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,940
Actually, it's over here.

306
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,070
Way to go, Sixty-six!

307
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,150
I didn't know you could do that...

308
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,280
I'm actually hoping to become
the king's personal magician.

309
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,030
If that happened, you'd be set.

310
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,580
Yeah!

311
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,330
I'm starting to feel it, too!

312
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,290
I'm gonna make some money!

313
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,460
Hey! It's time!

Quiet!

316
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,010
You will follow the order indicated
by the lots you received.
Servant

317
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,310
First person, step forward!

318
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm first.

319
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,350
Starting off with Sixty-six.

320
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,940
We'll be earning money from the first guy...

321
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,360
<i>The king's personal magician, huh?</i>

322
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,610
<i>Follow your dream, Sixty-six.</i>

323
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,750
So, where is the ball?

324
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,500
Huh?

325
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,840
I wanted to be the king's personal...

326
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,710
Next.

327
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,170
What?!

328
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,010
Second person, step forward!

329
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,840
<i>It's my turn...</i>

330
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,470
<i>It's my turn to show
the world what I can do!</i>

331
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,140
<i>I'll turn this pinch into a chance!</i>

332
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,310
Who's that?

333
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,850
Hey, is that...

334
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,690
Yeah! He came.

335
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,940
<i>Four of Humor... maybe his jokes will work.</i>

336
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,190
Four, reporting for duty.

337
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,080
Next.

338
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,750
I never thought Four would...

339
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,660
Number three, step forward.

340
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,540
Hey, are you okay?

341
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,420
It's my turn...

342
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,960
Huh? Didn't you say
you were quizzing her?

343
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,800
<i>I never expected this,</i>

344
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>but my quizzes are all I've got...</i>

345
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,470
<i>I have to make sure
the princess gets it right!</i>

346
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,180
<i>I'm fine.</i>

347
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,890
<i>Mistakes won't be forgiven.</i>

348
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,900
<i>I have to make it really easy...</i>

349
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,190
I-I am Six, and I will be doing a quiz.

350
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,820
Wh-What kind of bread can't you eat?

351
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,410
There are two possible answers!

352
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,330
First, a breadbox! Second, melon bread!

353
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,710
Which is it?

354
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,620
<i>He...</i>

355
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,090
I don't know.

356
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,010
That's... that's correct!

357
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,480
<i>I have but one regret.</i>

358
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,440
It's over!

359
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,320
The quizmaster's gone, too.

360
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,240
Next.

361
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,700
S-Seven! I shall list all the cities

362
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,490
that have hosted the Olympics...

363
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,580
<i>We shall not forget your courage, Seven!</i>

364
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,380
What's wrong with you?

365
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,290
Can no one entertain the princess?

366
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,760
Wh-what am I supposed to do?

367
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,260
I was going to act like a cheerleader...

368
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,380
Moron!

369
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,260
I'm splitting disposable
chopsticks with my butt.

370
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm giving a Nanjing Lily performance!

371
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,010
I'm dicing cabbage!

372
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,810
<i>We're all going to disappear...</i>

373
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,280
Hey, I hope you haven't forgotten me.

374
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Y-you...

375
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,370
In the world of comedy,

376
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,870
your comedic mannerisms
place you second to none.

377
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,620
You're Comedian Thirteen!

378
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,340
I've got a joke that'll
get the princess to laugh,

379
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,710
and then turn this situation around...

380
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,340
Wait, Thirteen! It's too dangerous!

381
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,430
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

382
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,180
Did you think I'd only
perform <i>Swan Lake</i>?

383
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,980
Well, keep watching...

384
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,570
I'll show you what true comedy is...

385
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,820
Comedian Thirteen!

386
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,780
Huh?

387
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,070
Why me?

388
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,990
Next! Number five!

389
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,500
How long will you make us wait? Hurry up!

390
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,750
Who's number five?

391
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,120
Is it you?

392
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
No! This is just the number on my hat!

393
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,580
Who is it?

394
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,010
Hey, you're number five...

395
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,760
It's over.

396
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,890
Hey, five! Show yourself!

397
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,270
Who is it?

398
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,360
What? Really?

399
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,280
Next. Anyone will do.

400
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,490
Just go.

401
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,990
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

402
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,220
<i>It'd be hopeless, no matter
how many lives I had!</i>

403
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,980
<i>I can't deal with this stupid game!</i>

404
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll go stand in the hallway!

405
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,550
One day
aru hi

406
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,180
I was talking with my dad
papa to futari de katariatta sa

407
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,430
About what joy it is to live in this world
kono yo ni ikiru yorokobi

408
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,140
And about sadness as well
soshite kanashimi no koto wo

409
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,020
Green, green
guriin guriin

410
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,110
Little birds sing in the blue sky
aozora ni wa kotori ga utai

411
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,940
Green, green
guriin guriin

412
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,070
On the little hill the blossoms show
oka no ue ni wa rara midori ga moeru

413
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,450
That day
sono toki

414
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,000
My dad told me, as he held me to his chest:
papa ga itta sa boku wo mune ni daki

415
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,880
"Even when all is hard on you, you shouldn't cry"
tsuraku kanashii toki ni mo rarara naku n ja nai to

416
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,800
Green, green
guriin guriin

417
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,090
A gentle wind passes through the blue sky
aozora ni wa soyokaze fuite

418
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,760
Green, green
guriin guriin

419
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,930
On the little hill the blossoms sway in the wind
oka no ue ni wa rara midori ga yureru

420
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:18,580
The blossoms spread
midori ga hirogaru

421
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm the sweet grande white chocolate
mocha frappuccino, ordered with a

422
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,050
short single-shot, caramel sauce,

423
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,050
hazelnut syrup, chocolate chip,
extra-whip espresso.

424
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,510
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 19.

425
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,270
Narration:     Aikawa Rikako

426
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,770
Don't miss it.

427
