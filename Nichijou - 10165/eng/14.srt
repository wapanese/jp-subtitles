00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,160
What are you doing?

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,380
Oh, Mr. Sakamoto.

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,880
Ah! Don't go over there.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,720
You've been shedding
a lot lately, haven't you?

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,760
Your fur will get on it.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,010
What's this?

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,310
You're treating me
like a nuisance?

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm going to get changed,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,020
so please step out for a minute.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,810

Look, it fits perfectly.

63
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,760
O-of course it is.

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,470
We had it made
especially for you.

65
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,510
How do I look?

66
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,050
Well... it looks good, I guess.

67
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,260
That isn't what I mean!

68
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,140
D-do I look like...
an ordinary girl?

69
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,480
You look just like
any other girl.

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,030
Mr. Sakamoto!

71
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,150
I love you, Mr. Sakamoto.

72
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,740
I really love you!

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,570
Your fur will stick to me!

74
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,410
What's wrong with you?

75
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,660
It's school! School!

76
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,080
I might even
make some friends.

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,540
You aren't listening to me!

78
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,250
"Hey, Nano."

79
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,920
"Why don't we get some
ice cream after school?"

80
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,840
Oh, yes. I'd love to go.

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,130
"Want to go to
karaoke afterwards?"

82
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,090
What? Yes, but
I've never been...

83
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,560
"I'll show you! Come with us!"

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,770
Ah, o-okay...

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
Just like that!

86
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,440
Good morning, Nano.

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,270
Professor!

88
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,320
Good morning.

89
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,820
Look, Professor!

90
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,150
What do you think?

91
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,450
How do I look?

92
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,860
Well...

93
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,490
Yeah, looks good.

94
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,040
Professor!

95
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,250
Professor, those pajamas
look good on you, too.

96
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,460
Yay! They look good?

97
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,750
Professor! They look good!

98
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,710
Aren't you just acting
like you always do?

99
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,510
Sakamoto! You look good, too!

100
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,670
You, too?

101
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,510
Sakamoto! You look good, too!

102
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,550
Handkerchief, check.
Student ID, check.

103
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,140
Textbooks, check.
Notebooks, check.

104
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,010
Pencil case, check.

105
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,470
Mechanical pencils, check.

106
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,140
Mechanical pencil lead, check.

107
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,400
Okay! Got everything!

108
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,940
Professor?

109
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,570
You forgot something.

110
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,570
Huh? What is it?

111
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,860
Feeling hungry?

112
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,660
Have a Snickers!

113
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,740
Professor!

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,870
I left breakfast and lunch in the
kitchen for you. Make sure to eat, okay?

115
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,590
Also, I'll bring in the
laundry after I come home.

116
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,630
So you don't have
to do anything.

117
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,380
Hey, when will school be over?

118
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,760
At around three thirty.

119
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,100
On my way home,
I'll go shopping for dinner,

120
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,680
so I'll probably be
home at around five.

121
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,430
Five...

122
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,850
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

123
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,860
Five is at night...

124
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Yes, but that's how school is.

125
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,610
I'll see you...

126
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,860
Uh, Professor?

127
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,780
Don't go!

128
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,120
What? But you said I could go...

129
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,490
Don't go!

130
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:11,910
But I'm going to be late!

131
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,830
No! Don't go!

132
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,670
Please, give me back my bag.

133
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,380
My left hand!

134
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,970
Hey, kid! Don't be unreasonable.

135
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,680
Professor...

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,430
Well, how about this?

137
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,680
For dinner tonight, we'll have
your favorite, omelette rice.

138
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,810
Um, and I'll buy some shark
sponge cake on the way home.

139
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,440
Uh... and... and I'll throw
in some strawberry juice.

140
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,240
Then...

141
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,030
Then?

142
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
Will you get me
an Akutagawa prize, too?

143
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,540
I... I can't do that!

144
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,870
<i>I was worried about
what would happen,</i>

145
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,540
<i>but I'm glad the
professor finally gave in...</i>

146
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,510
<i>Now, I can take my first
step as an ordinary person.</i>

147
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,560
<i>Oh, no. I forgot...</i>

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,310
<i>What am I going to do
about the key on my back?</i>

149
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,060
Things we think are cool!

150
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,330
All right, let's do this!

151
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,910
Oh! Upperclassmen
with motivation!

152
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,710
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

153
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,040
<i>I can't think of any solutions.</i>

154
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,590
<i>I came all this way...</i>

155
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,590
Allow me to introduce
our transfer student.

156
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,260
Ms. Shinonome.

157
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,630
Yes!

158
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,610
<i>E-everyone's noticed my key...</i>

159
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,110
Here.

160
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,740
Ms. Shinonome,
please write your name.

161
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,990
<i>My key really stands out.</i>

162
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,620
<i>I have to fool them somehow...</i>

163
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,790
M-m-my name is
Shinonome Nano!

164
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,170
Uh, um... and, um...

165
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,590
This key... uh, well...

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,550
It got stuck in my
back on my way here!

167
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,300
<i>Oh, no! I freaked them out...</i>

168
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,520
I mean, uh... Well, actually...

169
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,810
That was a lie!

170
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,440
<i>Oh, no... why am
I changing my story?</i>

171
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,070
<i>What do I do?</i>

172
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,530
Um, uh...

173
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,740
Well, it's not like

174
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,490
turning it will make my big toe into
a USB port, like a robot, or anything...

175
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,490

I hope the weather's

There's nothing to do...

187
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,650
Guess we should do some life-or-death
Go problems since we're the Go-Soccer Club.

188
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,150
I can't play real Go, though.

189
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,650
Excuse me!

190
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,870
Um, is this the Go-Soccer Club?

191
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,870
Yes...

192
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,620
I'd like to join.

193
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,380
We're happy to have you!

194
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,250
What's your name?

195
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,050
I-I'm Sakurai Makoto, a first-year.

196
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,170
I see.

197
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,630
I'm a second-year student
and club president, Daiku Kensaburo.

198
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,850
This is Sekiguchi, a first-year.

199
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,140
Take a seat.

200
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,180
Okay.

201
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,230
Well? What do
you want to do?

202
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,940
Do you want to play
the game of Life?

203
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,400
Uh, aren't we going to practice?

204
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,270
What?

205
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,780
For Go-Soccer...

206
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,120
The truth is, Go-Soccer
is a sport I made up.

207
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,120
There's no actual
game like that.

208
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
We're just a club for having fun.

209
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,290
A recreational club, if you will.

210
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,460
I see...

211
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,800
But in middle school,
I was in a Go-Soccer club.

212
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,590
I hadn't realized this
school had a Go-Soccer club.

213
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,100
But the other day, there was
a sign out in front of the school.

214
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,720
That's how I heard about you.

215
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,940
I was the middle school MVP.

216
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:54,820

Y-yes?

220
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,620
Uh, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

221
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,830
Well, on your back...

222
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,920
What? Uh, um... This...

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,250
What? Uh, um...

224
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,380
Um, well... Uh...
Well, uh...

225
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,710

227
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,050
What does a Go-Soccer club do?

228
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,970
It's difficult to explain...

229
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,930
I'll act it out myself.

230
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,440
You start with lifting...

231
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,860
From lifting, Go stones...

232
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,990
And then...

233
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,990
From Go stones...

234
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,700
One-man German Suplex!

235
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,370
That's the avalanche
pattern, Tertiary Star!

236
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,380
<i>What is this?</i>

237
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,010
<i>I started this club without
much thought, but this...
Go-Soccer Club</i>

238
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,510
<i>This is getting interesting!</i>

241
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,450
What are you doing?

242
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,620
Where are you going, Buddy?

243
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,620
Short Thoughts

244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,380
Sakamoto!

245
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,550
Sakamoto, Sakamoto, Sakamoto!
Hey! Don't! Stop!

246
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,010
When asked,
"What are you doing?",

247
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,010
she replied, "Spinning".

252
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,770
Oh, Nano, you
brought a lunch.

253
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,190
Huh? Oh, y-yes.

254
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,940
It looks good.

255
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,690
Do you always
pack a lunch?

256
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,530
Yes! I'm normal, after all.

257
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,540
You can look at it.

258
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,840
That's pretty cool...

259
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,220
Mio, thanks for waiting.

260
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,100
You're late, Yukko.

261
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,310
Lunch is almost over.

262
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,600
Sorry, sorry.

263
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,060
On my way to buy lunch,

264
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,140
a car and a dog stole my shoes.

265
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,560
Chasing them down was a lot of work...

266
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,190
I'm not sure I understand,

267
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,230
but it sounds pretty incredible.

268
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,990
I'm just glad you
made it back with lunch.

269
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,320
Huh? Yukko, where's your lunch?

270
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,580
I ate it on the way here.

271
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,660
What did you have?

272
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,330
Twice-cooked pork.

273
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,380
Wow! Twice-cooked...
well, whatever.

274
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,920
Uh, why don't you
eat with us, Nano?

275
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,840
What?

276
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,670
Tell us about yourself.

277
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,970
O-oh...

278
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,890
<i>I wonder if they think
I'm an ordinary girl.</i>

279
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,100
<i>Maybe we can be friends!</i>

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,640
Hey, what's that thing on your...

281
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,270
Uh, um... This isn't
anything weird! It's, um...

282
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,280
You wouldn't happen to
be a robot, would you?

283
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,870
What are you talking about?

284
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,080
Sorry. Yukko's an idiot.

285
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,370
We're almost out of time.

286
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,750
Nano, sorry.

287
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,870
Let's have a quick lunch today.

288
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,170
Let's see...

289
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,400
Hey, Yukko. Is this...

290
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,650
It's fried mackerel.

291
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,110
What did I ask for?

292
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,240
Huh? Didn't you
say fried mackerel?

293
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,860
I asked for fried <i>noodles</i>!

294
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,330
Whoops... you mean
I misheard you?

295
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,080
Sorry, sorry.

296
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,460
This isn't some minor problem!

297
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,130
It's a serious issue!

298
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,500
Really? They're so similar.

299
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,250
It's just a difference
of a few letters.

300
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,000
But...

301
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,050
This is fine...

302
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,850
So, where's my rice?

303
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,970
What do you mean?

304
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,600
My white rice!

305
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,270
What? That's all I brought.

306
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,440
How am I supposed
to eat this by itself?

307
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,020
Huh? But you said you
wanted fried mackerel...

308
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,940
I said fried noodles!

309
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,240
Fried! Freaking! Noodles!

310
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,450
I... I see.

311
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:36,030
But this will be good
material for your blog and...

312
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,200
I don't have a computer!

313
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,370
You don't have to get so mad...

314
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,210
Fine, I'll go buy
you another lunch.

315
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,000
Give me some money—

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,630
Why do I have to pay again?!

317
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,170
Because I don't
have any money.

318
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,840
Forget it...

319
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,300
Just go get it.

320
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,850
Lunch is almost over.

321
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,430
Okay, okay.

322
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,480
It's just...

323
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,100
What?

324
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,770
It's just a peso!

325
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,860
<i>All I have is the Argentinian
peso I kept as a souvenir...</i>

326
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,400
What?

327
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,990
Argentinian!

328
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,280
All I have is a peso!

329
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,120
Argentinian peso!

330
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,200
You were the one who
bought the wrong thing!

331
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,740
You should pay for it!

332
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,710
I bought my own lunch,
so I don't have any money...

333
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,750
Well, what about my lunch?

334
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,090
Uh, um... you can have...

335
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,460
mackerel!

336
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,710
You've been getting on
my nerves for a while now!

337
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,970
Mackerel?

338
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,590
You've been getting on
my nerves for a while now!

339
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,510
You're always copying
my homework!

340
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,640
Why don't you do it
yourself for once, you idiot?!

341
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,690
My stupidity has nothing
to do with your lunch.

342
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,110
It's got everything
to do with my lunch!

343
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,520
What? How?

344
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,070
You misheard me
because you're stupid!

345
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,820
Everyone makes mistakes like this...

346
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,450
You must be <i>really</i> petty,
going on and on like this!

347
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,240
I didn't have breakfast,

348
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,580
so it's a matter of life or death!

349
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,710
Not that an idiot
would understand!

350
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,710
I'm not stupid!

351
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,880
Didn't you just call
yourself stupid?

352
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,790
Just so you know,

353
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,550
I'm never letting you
copy my homework again!

354
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,210
Fine, who cares?

355
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,880
If you forget your homework,

356
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,180
I won't let you copy mine!

357
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,930
Who would want to copy
your terrible homework?

358
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,810
I can't believe you
bought the wrong lunch

359
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,390
and didn't even apologize!

360
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,560
Get on the ground! Kneel!

361
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,310
Fine, fine, fine, fine!

362
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,190
You want me on
the ground, do you?

363
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,400
Will that make you happy?

364
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,940
I'm <i>so</i> sorry for <i>displeasing</i> you!

365
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,440
There! I apologized!

366
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,280
Is that good enough for you? Huh?!

367
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,910
What? You didn't even kneel.

368
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,450
That's right, I didn't...

369
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,870
I was just bending! Bending...

370
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,080
Why won't you kneel?

371
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,380
Because I'm pissed!

372
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,090
Are you sure you're
not the stupid one, Mio?

373
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,010
What was that weird drawing
you did the other day?

374
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,760
That... that weird drawing...

375
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,220
Are you stupid? That's...

376
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
What was that weird drawing?

377
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,850
What were you thinking?

378
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,730
<i>Really</i> pissed off!

379
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,890
Are you stupid?

380
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,940
Are you stupid? Are you
stupid? Are you stupid?

381
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,060
What's wrong with you?

382
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,030
You're stupid for drawing
that stupid picture!

383
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,530
Come on! Eat up!

384
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,070
Here's the fried frickin'
mackerel you asked for!

385
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,660
I asked for fried noodles!

386
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,370
Kneel and apologize!

387
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,240
Kiss the ground!

388
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
I already bought it!

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,790
As a human being,
you should apologize!

390
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,830
You piece of trash!

391
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,750
Fine! I'll show you the
true meaning of kneeling!

392
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,220
This is the true
meaning of kneeling!

393
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,220
Where's the apology for
buying me fried mackerel?

394
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,560
You should apologize
when you kneel!

395
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,060
Say it...

396
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,190
Say you're sorry for
buying me fried mackerel!

397
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,020
Say you're sorry
for being stupid!

398
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,570
Apologize from the
bottom of your heart!

399
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,730
You human trash!

400
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,190
Come on, hurry!

401
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,740
Say it, stupid!

402
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,530
Apologize, you moron!

403
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,490
Trash! Stupid! Idiot!

404
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,470
Stop calling me an idiot, Mio!

405
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,010
You think you know me
after just six months?!

406
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,100
You think you understand my art?!

407
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,770
I do! If you're so good at drawing,

408
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,520
why don't you
become a comic artist?!

409
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,110
Wh-what are you talking
about? You're so dumb!

410
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,070
What? Takes one to
know one, you idiot!

411
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,990
You just called
yourself an idiot.

412
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,990
No, I didn't!

413
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,570
You did!

414
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,950
But... I don't dislike
that about you...

415
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,000
What? What are
you talking about?

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,090
You're smart!

417
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,260
Sh-shut up, you comedic genius.

418
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,390
Wh-what are you talking about?
You're a fantastic artist!

419
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,100
Shut up! You're a fast runner!

420
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,390
You're smart!

421
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,680
You're positive!

422
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,060
You're smart!

423
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,560
No, you're smart!

424
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,660
Amazing!

425
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,920
Youth

426
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,930
<i>Captain! I hate it!</i>

427
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,720
<i>Don't cry. You've still got next year.</i>

428
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,220
<i>I promise I'll work hard for you!</i>

429
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,230
<i>All right!</i>

430
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,480
<i>That was so long ago...</i>

431
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,150
Hey, Nano. Did you
have fun at school?

432
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,320
Well, you know,
a lot happened.

433
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,660
But it was...

434
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,490
How was it? How was it?

435
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,120
Friends are amazing!

436
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,120
That's amazing!

437
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't understand.

438
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,340
Huh? What?

439
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,350
Professor!

440
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,920
What?

441
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,180
Please remove the
key on my back!

442
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,390
No.

443
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,940
Why not? It interferes
with my school life...

444
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,190
Today, people suspected
me of being a robot!

445
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,740
I can't make friends with this...

446
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Sure you can. It's cute.

447
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,370
It's not cute!

448
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,950
It is so cute.

449
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,910
Let's just eat, already.

450
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,750
Professor!

451
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:14,640
If my wish can come true today,
Ima watashi no negaigoto ga

452
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:25,780
then I’ll wish for wings!
Kanau naraba tsubasa ga hoshii

453
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:35,040
Please add white wings to my back
Kono senaka ni tori no youni

454
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:48,300
so I can be like a bird!
Shiroi tsubasa tsukete kudasai

455
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,850
I want to spread my wings
Kono oozora ni tsubasa wo hiroge

456
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,850
and fly into this wide sky!
Tonde yukitai yo

457
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,110
I want to flap my wings and fly to this
Kanashimi no nai jiyuu na sora he

458
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:12,410
free sky filled with happiness!
Tsubasa hatamekase yukitai

459
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm a soccer ball.

460
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,630
Kicked, kicked,
kicked, and kicked.

461
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,510
Kicked, kicked, and
kicked until I collapse.

462
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,930
Kicked until the day I
die, and then I'll sleep.

463
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,470
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 15.

464
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,520
Narration:     Chiba Shigeru

465
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,230
Don't miss it!
