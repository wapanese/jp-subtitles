00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,650
Motivation

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,270
What's wrong, Yukko?

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,650
I just don't have any motivation.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,110
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,450
Come on, we're high school students,

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,740
and it's the start of the new semester.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,280
If you just get started,

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,620
the motivation will come to you naturally.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,950
But I don't have the
motivation to get started.

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,290
What do I do about that?

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,420
The motivation to get started, huh?

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,710
You just have get started anyway!

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,670
All right!

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,220
I wish I could be a simpleton.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,070
Professor, please wake up already!

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,960
Good morning.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,170
What're you doing?

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,750
Making breakfast. We're having fried fish.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,380
What? But, omelet rice...

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,470
Didn't you already eat that yesterday?

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,680
Besides, fish is good for you.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,640
Don't be picky.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,470
If you don't eat anything, you won't grow...

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,400
Ah, that's our breakfast!

26
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,690
What?

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,360
Oh, no!

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,740
This isn't a robot part,

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,240
it's a... uh...

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,450
It ran away.

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,540
Wait!

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,790
Bye.

33
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,010
<i>Wait, what if that cat is down on his luck... ?</i>

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm going to crash!

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,760

I only just noticed

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,380
that I fell in love

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,010
All I think of the whole day is you, you, you

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,850
and I can't do anything about it

Nah, the love is one-sided

My train of thought slips into chaos

This is the first time it has happened to me,

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,790
maybe I have a fever?

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,630
My love awakened with a bang and my heart beat faster

There was no pride in it

The conversation we h-h-had goes in circles

That's the role of an awkward silence

and seems to fly

Salmon

68
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,600
Mio, selamat pagi.

69
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,440
Yukko, good morning.

70
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,270
What should I do?

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,940
I forgot to bring my student ID.

72
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,690
<i>What? No response to selamat pagi?</i>

73
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,820
You don't think an upperclassman

74
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,110
will call me out on it, do you?

75
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,570
If that happens,

76
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,700
why not just say you're a third year?

77
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,410
That won't solve anything.

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,950
What? Was that thunder?

79
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,790
But it's sunny.

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,290
We might have a sudden storm!

81
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,080
With showers and hail!

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
It's raining wooden figurines.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,220
A-are you okay, Yukko?

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,470
I can't believe it's a figurine...

85
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,430
What a surprise.

86
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,220
I wonder where it came from.

87
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,100
I don't know...

88
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,440
But not many people ever get hit in the head by a wooden figurine!

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,230
That hardly ever happens to anyone, right?

90
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,440
Not that I've seen.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,490
Maybe I'm lucky!

92
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,660
I'm not lucky...

93
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,620
Yukko, are you okay?

94
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,830
I can't believe it's a red cow...

95
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,040
A red cow...

96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,670
No, I'm not unlucky.

97
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,000
Think of it this way, Mio.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,170
I should be glad no
raw foods have hit me.

99
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,760
It could have been worse.

100
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,350
It's salmon!

Prefectural High School
Prefectural High School

102
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,370
Morning.

103
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,830
Good morning.

104
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,750
Mai, good morning.

105
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,670
Selamat pagi!

106
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,500
Good morning.

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,840
Mai, what are you reading?

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,670
A real estate magazine.

109
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,930
What? Mai, are you moving?

110
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,760
Undecided.

111
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,470
<i>No response to selamat pagi?</i>

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,690
<i>Fine. I guess I'll have to put this phrase to sleep.</i>

113
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,230
Yukko...

114
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,940
Selamat malam.

115
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,070
Oh, Mai! Don't you mean selamat pagi?

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,450
<i>What language is that?</i>

117
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,410
H-homeroom is starting...

118
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,630
When I arrived at school this morning,

119
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,960
I found this in my shoe locker.

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,430
Did someone put this in there?

121
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,770
U-um, if anyone knows
who did this, please tell me!

122
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,650
Mio, who'd do
something like that?

123
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,270
Maybe it was a prank?

124
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,690
Maybe it was a student
with a crush on her.

125
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,900
But a statue of the Maitreya Buddha?

126
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,530
But I guess I can understand what it's like

127
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,830
to have one-sided feelings
for someone, though.

128
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,580
You mean like your
feelings for Sasahara?

129
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,710
Y-you idiot!

130
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,590
<i>Where am I?</i>

131
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,430
I need to get home.

132
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,770
The professor must be worried,

133
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,280
and I left the grill on.

134
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,580
I can't get down!

135
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,630
I lost my chopsticks.

136
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,920
And my slipper!

137
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,680
What am I going to do?

138
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,470
I lost my arm!

139
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,850
Now everyone will know I'm a robot...

140
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,860
Here we go.

141
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,530
Wonderful

142
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm finished.

143
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,380
Hey now, if you don't hurry up and eat,

144
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,590
we'll be late to fifth period.

145
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,220
Huh? I thought you liked wieners.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,730
I save the tastiest part
of my lunch for last.

147
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,860
And I wrap it up by saying "delicious".

148
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,860
Now then, here I go!

149
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,360
Nichijou: Everyday Life, Part 2

150
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,480
It slipped through!

151
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,980
It's not over yet!

152
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,460
It's over!

153
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,670
Not yet!

154
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,290
One...

155
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,840
Two...

156
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,760
Three!

157
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,100
Safe!

158
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,980
You're definitely out!

159
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,940
Jeez, Mio. Don't you know the three second rule?

160
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,240
No, that was a total out!

161
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,580
Delicious!

162
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,250
<i>She's kind of an idiot...</i>

163
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,470
First comes rock! Then comes paper...

164
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,220
You can't throw all of them,

165
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,430
rock, paper, scissors!

166
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,730
Okay!

167
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,490
Good morning, everyone.

168
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,910
Spring is here,

169
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,750
and a new year has begun,
but it's still quite cold.

170
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm twice as cold as
any of you, though.

171
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,630
Nichijou: Everyday Life, Part 3

172
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,550
In any case, be sure not to catch a cold.

173
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,760
All right?

174
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,640
Please, promise your
principal that you won't.

175
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,600
If you break that promise...

176
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,780
I'll become the principal of another school.

177
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,370
Hey, Mio.

178
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,990
What is it? We'll get in trouble for talking.

179
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,790
Do you think that the principal knows

180
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,370
how old all of his jokes are?

181
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,090
He must know better than anyone

182
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,960
that nobody thinks they're funny...

183
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,420
I don't know.

184
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,550
<i>Wait, what if he knows they're not funny,</i>

185
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,720
<i>but he just wants to show today's corrupt youth the meaning of hard work?</i>

186
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,520
<i>If that's the case, this
principal is absolutely diabolical!</i>

187
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,860
<i>Mai?</i>

188
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,410
Mai...

189
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,530
You don't think she
really thought his joke was...

190
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,290
<i>I've never seen Mai
laugh so hard before...</i>

191
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,160
<i>All right, I'll try this!</i>

192
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,840
<i>Why do I feel</i>

193
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,380
<i>that if I say anything right
now, I'll lose everything?</i>

194
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,800
Yukko...

195
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,640
Oh, sorry. Never mind.

196
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,980
<i>I'll wait just a bit longer.</i>

197
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,740
<i>Before I remove it.</i>

198
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,660
Squid Tentacle

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,330
Moving on, Ms. Sakurai has an important message for you all.

200
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,050
Ms. Sakurai, if you please.

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,170
Um, Ms. Sakurai...

202
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,010
Yes!

203
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,550
Excuse me, I'm the
student adviser, Ms. Sakurai.

204
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,060
Please excuse me...

205
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,020
<i>Oh, being in front of this many people makes me nervous.</i>

206
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,230
<i>No, I can't act this way.</i>

207
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,360
<i>Otherwise, I'll never become
the teacher I want to be.</i>

208
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,110
<i>I have to swallow my fears!</i>

209
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,910
<i>I know!</i>

210
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,950
Recently, I've seen a lot
of goats around school.

211
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,660
Please, do not bring
your goats to school!

212
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,120
Goats?

213
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,540
What do you have against goats?!

214
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,300
Arriving by goat...

215
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,430
doesn't violate school policy!

216
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,640
What? Uh...

217
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,140
Mio, isn't that Sasahara?

218
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,890
Oh? Is that so...

219
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,900
I will allow goats!

220
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,410
No you can't! Cannot! I forbid it!

221
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,160
Bringing a goat is definitely not okay!

222
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,410
Don't say that, Tachibana Misato.

223
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,670
Why must I walk on my own two legs?

224
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,590
As the Sasahara family's eldest son...

225
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,010
Who cares if you're the
Sasahara family's eldest son?

226
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,340
Aren't the Sasaharas just a farming family?

227
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,680
So what?

228
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,180
What's wrong with an eldest son calling himself the eldest son?

229
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,600
Sasahara comes from a farming family.

230
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,690
I feel deceived.

231
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,480
<i>That goat by the bicycles was Sasahara's...</i>

232
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,610
Lawsuit Victory

233
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,110
<i>Sasahara came for me on a white goat!</i>

234
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,000
Ah, happy new year.

235
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,050
Me, too...

236
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,050
Mio!

237
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,810
Talking on your phone while riding a bike is extremely dangerous.

238
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,020
Don't do it at all! Finally...

239
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,110
I found a Maitreya in my
shoe locker this morning.

240
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,360
I don't find this sort of action to be acceptable!

241
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,700
Excuse me! Coming through...

242
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,950
Maitreya...

243
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,450
Mai, don't just stop all of a sudden!

244
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,330
<i>Is this...</i>

245
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,380
<i>déjà vu, or something?</i>

246
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,000
Now, who did it?

247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,470
I won't be mad, so please raise your hand.

248
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,010
We'll stay here all morning
until you turn yourself in!

249
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,100
Who did it?

250
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,350
Turn yourself in.

251
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,320
Well, I heard it was your birthday, Ms. Sakurai...

252
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,700
Oh my, so you really don't like Maitreya?

253
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,250
I thought you'd like it for your birthday,

254
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,670
but you didn't want a Maitreya statue.

255
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,210
Principal

256
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,590
This concludes the
morning announcements.

257
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Thank you for your
work until now, Principal.

258
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,810
Vice Principal?

259
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,940
Button

260
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,610
Don't you feel tempted to
push the fire alarm button?

261
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,690
You're right, I do.

262
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,320
Why don't you push it?

263
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,030
The last time I pushed it,
the alarm didn't go off.

264
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,740
Really?

265
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,870
What? A fire?

266
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,830
No way!

267
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,330
What do we do? Should we run?

268
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,670
We have to get outside!

269
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,250
Stop pushing me!

270
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,340
You pushed me first!

271
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,880
What are you talking about?

272
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,380
I've always hated you!

273
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,930
Cut it out! Someone could die!

274
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,350
Just run! You can argue later!

275
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,520
Excuse me.

276
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,990
Excuse me, but do you know

277
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,410
Excuse me.

278
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,120
What does "clueless" mean?

279
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,870
Excuse me, but could you
tell me what "clueless" means?

280
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,500
Help me!

281
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,750
Hey!

282
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,130
Captain, what's "clueless"?

283
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,880
You are.

284
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Class 2-P, Sasahara Koujirou.

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,090
Requirements and Affairs

286
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,970
Please see Tomioka in the
faculty office immediately.

287
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:43,600
Requirements and Affairs

288
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,600
I know it doesn't violate school policy,

289
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,190
but why do you have to ride a goat?

290
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,900
Can't we work this out?

291
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,440
If you don't like walking,
you could always ride a bike.

292
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,320
So long as it's not a goat.

293
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,200
Sir.

294
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,450
It's Tomioka.

295
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,320
Tomioka.

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,820
Call me teacher.

297
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,830
Teacher, could you please call him
Sasahara Kojiro, rather than "goat"?

298
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,420
He's a goat for now.

299
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,340
Nichijou: Everyday Life, Part 4

300
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,930
<i>My name is Shinonome Nano.</i>

301
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,930
<i>I'm a robot, made by
the professor I live with.</i>

302
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,810
<i>The professor seems to be doing research,</i>

303
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,730
<i>so she stays home all day.</i>

304
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,440
<i>I spend my days helping her.</i>

305
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,870
Professor, I warmed up some milk for y—

306
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,790
<i>I don't have any special
features, but I can still feel pain.</i>

307
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,630
Nano, what's wrong?

308
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,960
Professor, my toe... My toe...

309
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,970
Y-y-your t-t-toe...

310
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,720
It should be all right now.

311
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,480
<i>I don't have any special features,</i>

312
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,230
<i>but my toe can come off.</i>

313
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,530
Professor, what is this key for?

314
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,120
I've never turned it?

315
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,950
No, but it spins every now and then.

316
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,750
If you turn it like this...

317
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,130
What's going on?

318
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,550
<i>I'm sorry, I do have special features.</i>

319
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,430
See? Fun, isn't it?

320
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,310
Is that the only reason this key is here?

321
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,770
Yup.

322
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,980
That's the only reason for this key?

323
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,060
Yup!

324
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,310
Please remove it!

325
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,810
Nope!

326
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,980
It's cute.

327
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,610
I'm serious. Please remove it!

328
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,400
What? But it's cute...

329
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,740
I want to be more normal.

330
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,580
I want to sit in chairs normally,

331
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,700
and roll over normally in my sleep.

332
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
I can't go to school like this.

333
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,130
I wish I wasn't a robot.

334
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,260
Nano...

335
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,310
I-I'm just kidding!

336
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,890
You're being silly, Professor.

337
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,230
Then take it...

338
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,020
What?

339
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,850
Take my Akutagawa Prize!

340
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,150
Why?

341
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,070
Take my Akutagawa Prize!

342
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,650
<i>This is my everyday life.</i>

343
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,410
<i>Where am I?</i>

344
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,810
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

345
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:17,890
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

346
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,230
and at times my friends and I chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

347
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,030
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

348
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,910
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

349
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,880
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

350
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,180
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

351
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:59,100
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

352
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,070
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

353
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:14,330
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

354
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:24,340
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

355
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,470
Hello! I'm Nano's big toe.

356
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,510
