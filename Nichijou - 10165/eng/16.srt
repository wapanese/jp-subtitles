00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,440
Okay, that's all for today.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,690
The days have gotten shorter,

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,400
so be sure to head home
before it gets dark, okay?

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,320
All right! Time to play!

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,500

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,330
Yes?

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,290
Let's walk home together.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,380
Want to get something
to eat at the station?

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,340
What?

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,460
Well?

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,840
Uh, um...

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,720
Mio, do you want to... huh?

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,340
She already left?

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,850
So, Nano...

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,010
Huh?

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,020
I left without saying anything...

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,780
I hope I didn't offend Aioi.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,740
If only I had introduced
myself more normally...

<i>Tall?</i>

<i>Does "T"  mean "tall"?</i>

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,520
Well, I was thinking
it was a T-style espresso...

78
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,650
Uh, then...

79
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,070
Could I get a small espresso T?

Grandpa, I'm gonna throw it.

Hey now, Mi,

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,970
it won't reach me from
all the way over there.

122
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,800
<i>I didn't think he'd get this happy.</i>

Oh, well...

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,270
Throw it as hard as you can.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,740
What's wrong?

140
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,620
You left the second

Oh, r-right.

00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,080
But it's not too late.
Let's walk home together.

143
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,410
Actually, I've got something to do.

144
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,500
Really? What?

145
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,250
Uh, well, it's nothing...

146
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,340
What's with the attitude?

147
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,840
It's, you know...

148
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Just tell me! Just tell me!

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,260

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,350
Sorry!

153
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,060
What? Yukko, what are you doing?

154
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,150
That just slipped out!

155
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,280
You surprised me, too.

156
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,150
I wasn't expecting an apology.

157
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,190
Sorry.

158
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,530
Did you need something?

159
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,910
Lately, we've found a lot of counterfeit bills in vending machines.

160
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,410
I was wondering if you'd
seen anyone suspicious.

161
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,910
Mio, have you?

162
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,210
I don't come this way too often.

163
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,460
According to witnesses,

164
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,630
the culprit had a beige
tote bag with a red line...

165
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,720
You can't really...

166
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,340
<i>What?!</i>

167
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,010
<i>What is this strange reaction?</i>

168
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,970
<i>Do you have counterfeit bills? Do you?</i>

169
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,680
<i>No, no. That's impossible...</i>

170
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,690
Give me a break, Mio...

171
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,150
<i>What?!</i>

172
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>Why is she turning herself in?</i>

173
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,360
Hey, are you carrying
counterfeit bills?

174
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
O-of course not...

175
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,620
She's just preparing in case a
stray volleyball comes her way.

176
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Right, Mio?

177
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,330
All right.

178
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,420
Just to be sure,
let me check your bags.

179
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,330
Here you go!

180
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,090
Come on, Mio—

181
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,420
<i>No!</i>

182
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,840
<i>She pulled one out!</i>

183
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,920
<i>She pulled out a counterfeit bill!</i>

184
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,470
<i>She's done for.</i>

185
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,600
<i>I didn't think she
actually had any...</i>

186
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,220
Please forgive me.

187
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,850
Please forgive me!

188
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,060
Is this the only counterfeit bill you have?

189
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,520
It isn't counterfeit!
It's real, and it's a bribe!

190
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,650
I don't understand.

191
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Just let me see your...

192
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,950
Hey! Why are you resisting?

193
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,360
Because it belongs to a relative!

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,620
It's my relative's bag!

195
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,410
<i>You're such an idiot.</i>

196
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,640
<i>One! Two!</i>

197
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,230
<i>Three!</i>

198
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,440
<i>Four!</i>

199
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,310
<i>Five!</i>

200
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,940
<i>Six?</i>

201
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,190
<i>Passion...</i>

202
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,580
<i>A fever, you idiot.</i>

203
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,460
<i>Idiot. Idiot. Idiot... Idiot...</i>

204
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,390
What? What is this?
Some kind of accident?

205
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,970
Oh, Kojirou. There you are.

206
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,190
You're just like a newborn.

207
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,230
Mio!

208
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,150
Aren't you coming out to eat?

209
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,440
Your food will get cold.

210
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,110
Hey, Mio... hey!

211
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,410
This is Kojirou!

212
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,130
What are you...

213
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,520
Okay! That's all for today.

214
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,980
I've handed out all the material
the midterm exam will cover,

215
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,400
so be sure you get a copy.

216
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,280
Goodbye!

217
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,790
Nano always goes home right away.

218
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,840
Goodbye!

219
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,300
Goodbye.

220
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,130
Bye.

221
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,380
Goodbye.

222
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,800
Short Thoughts

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:05,930
Goodbye.

224
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,760
When I can, I like to
pretend I know everyone.

225
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,810
Goodbye.

226
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,750
Yukko, can I borrow your eraser?

227
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,830
Sure.

228
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,120
Guess which one.

229
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,250
Mai, can I borrow your eraser?

230
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,630
Wow!

231
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,250
Okay.

232
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,550
Here.

233
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,500
A character eraser!

234
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,840
This won't erase anything.

235
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,090
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 66

236
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,380
It's just going to smudge.

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,850
Yukko, can I borrow your eraser?

238
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,260
Mai, you don't have one, either?

239
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,930
You girls are hopeless.

240
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,270
Guess which one.

241
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,850
This one.

242
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,190
Whoa!

243
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,690
No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,360
The rule is only one at a time,
so that didn't count.

245
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,030
When did you make that rule?

246
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,190
You first, Mai.

247
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,820
Come, come... look all you want.

248
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,620
No, no! No offensive attacks!

249
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,500
Mai, you've got one pena.

250
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,790
One pena?

251
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,330
One penalty.

252
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,790
What happens if you have one penalty?

253
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,260
You have to buy me twenty-three juices!

254
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,010
<i>She's holding onto that grudge.</i>

255
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,550
Here, Yukko. Baby Star.

256
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,510
It's opening...

257
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,730
That was close! It almost opened!

258
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,940
It's not "vyavalokayanti",
it's "vyavalokayati".

259
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,070
I thought that would work...

260
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,610
That's two pena!

261
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,860
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot...

262
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,370
Not so fast!

263
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,450
I'd never use the hand
holding my eraser.

264
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,240
That one.

265
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh, no! She tricked me!

266
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,210
Come on, Yukko. Hand it over.

267
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes. You got it.

268
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,670
A character eraser!

269
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,590
Thank you very much!

270
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,010
You can't erase anything
with a character eraser.

271
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,970
Yeah, really.

272
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,850
It's Nano.

273
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,060
You're right.

274
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,650
Maybe Nano really is a robot.

275
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,230
Just let it go.

276
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,690
It hurts Nano's feelings.

277
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,980
Huh? Why?

278
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,440
Robots are cool!

279
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,110
What?

280
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,620
Love-like

281
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,630
Hey.

282
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,510
You want to run?

284
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,270
Dad... hey, Dad!
The Truth of
15 Years

285
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,690
Do I really have to wear this outside?

286
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,360
It's embarrassing!

287
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,030
Embarrassing, you say?

288
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,490
You cowardly grass dumpling!

Shinonome Laboratory...

293
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,230
A laboratory, huh? That's pretty cool!

294
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,730
Excuse me! Anyone home?

295
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,940
Huh? Maybe no one's here.

296
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,110
Yes! I'm coming.

297
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,320
Sorry to keep you...

298
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,990
Huh?!

00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,910
<i>Wh-wh-wh-what
am I going to do?</i>

300
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,750
<i>Why is Aioi here?</i>

301
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,500
<i>If she meets the professor,</i>

302
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,790
Coming!

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,960

Ah. Hello.

305
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,080
Huh? Where's Nano?

306
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,880
<i>What should I do?
Huh? Where's Nano?</i>

307
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,840
Nano's right there. Are you her friend?

308
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,260
<i>Maybe she's just here
to deliver a worksheet.
Nano's right there. Are you her friend?</i>

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,170
Yeah.
<i>Maybe she's just here

310
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,220
Yay! Come on in!
<i>Maybe she's just here

Yay! Come on in!

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,720
<i>If that's all, I can...
Yay! Come on in!</i>

313
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,760
Pardon me.
<i>If that's all, I can...</i>

314
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,180
Come this way.

315
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,050
Don't mind me.

316
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,510
<i>Idiot!</i>

317
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,150
<i>Well, she's already inside.</i>

318
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,690
<i>I'll just ask her what she wants
before the professor does anything.</i>

319
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,570
I'm hungr...

320
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,450
What was that voice?

321
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,780
That's Sakamoto, our cat. He can talk.

322
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,240
<i>Professor!</i>

323
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,790
Really?

324
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,160
O-of course he can't.

325
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,880
M-Mr. Sakamoto,
please meow! Meow!

326
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,540
Huh? Why do I have to...

327
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,250
Meow, Mr. Sakamoto!

328
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,800
M-meow...

329
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,010
See? He's just a cat.

330
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,340
Ah, okay.

331
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,350
Mr. Sakamoto, we have a guest today, so please play outside, okay?

332
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,560
What?

333
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,570
Meow...

334
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,320
I haven't introduced myself yet.

335
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,650
I'm Aioi Yukko.

336
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,570
Are you Nano's little sister?

337
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,910
No, I'm the professor. I made Nano.

338
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,700
Made her?

339
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,080
Amazing! You're little,
but you're amazing!

340
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,710
I'm just a professor...

341
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,750
No, Aioi!

342
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,880
She's my relative's daughter.

343
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,550
Both of her parents work and don't get home until late at night,

344
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,970
so I'm looking after her...

345
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,050
Right? Isn't that right?

346
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,300
What are you talking about?

347
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,100
You... idiot!

348
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,600
Really?

349
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,020
Excuse me! I'll fetch more tea.

350
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,600
Nano, wait a second.

351
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,270
If you want tea...

352
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,980
What?

353
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,150
Here you go.

354
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,240
Amazing! Amazing!

355
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,410
This one's a gun.

356
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,500
Cool! Super cool!

357
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,580
<i>I can't take any more.</i>

358
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,250
Next, let's have a
cool phrase contest!

359
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,960
Yeah!

360
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,180
Then, I'll start...

361
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,260
Hey... you can't be serious. Get up...

362
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,350
Get up!

363
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,520
So cool!

364
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,190
You're next!

365
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,890
Okay!

366
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,440
Rhinoceros beetle.

367
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,610
So cool!

368
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,860
<i>Why did Aioi come here?</i>

369
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,240
They're on each other!

370
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,110
Uncle, uncle.

371
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,530
So small, so small.

372
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,120
So big...

373
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,030
Okay, I'm going home!

374
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,120
<i>She didn't have a reason!</i>

375
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,380
Thanks for today.
Sorry for staying so late.

376
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,340
Not at all...

377
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Uh, Aioi?

378
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,340
I've actually been
studying magic tricks,

379
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,600
so I'm not a robot or anything...

380
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,230
Yeah, I already know
you're not a robot.

381
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,350
There we go.

382
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,350
Nano, you're just Nano.

383
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,110
Isn't that enough?

384
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,900
I just came here to tell you that.

385
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,240
But I forgot all about it.

386
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,330
See you later.

387
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,910
Okay...

388
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,170
Aioi!

389
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,590
Uh...

390
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,720
If you'd like to come over again...

391
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,220
Sure! I will!

392
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,680
Really? Hooray!

393
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,560
Next time, let's draw.

394
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,400
Okay! I'll draw a shark!

395
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
A shark? That's pretty cool!

396
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,440
Yeah, so cool...

397
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,340
Professor! Me, too!

398
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:46,530
Let's all sing together, and merge our hearts
minna de utaou kokoro wo hitotsu ni shite

399
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:57,080
Even during the sad times and the painful times
kanashii toki mo tsurai toki mo

400
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:08,300
Let's all sing together with a deafening voice
minna de utaou ookina koe wo dashite

401
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:18,730
Let's sing and ignore our uneasiness
hazukashigarazu utaou yo

402
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:29,450
A song that sets your heart on fire is sure to reach you
kokoro moeru uta ga uta ga kitto kimi no moto he

403
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:40,290
Sparkle, and spread my song throughout the world
kirameke sekaijuu ni boku no uta wo nosete

404
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:52,800
Sparkle, and deliver my message of love throughout the world
kirameke sekaijuu ni todoke ai no messeeji

405
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,810
Hey, Sakamoto.

406
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,560
See you later.

407
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
Later.

408
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,710
Well, whatever.

409
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,920
Plus-screw sounds good, doesn't it?

410
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,220
It sounds so positive.

411
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,350
You always have to live positively.

412
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,510
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 17.

414
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,180
