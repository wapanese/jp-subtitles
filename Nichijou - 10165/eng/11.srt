1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey, you two.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,650
How much longer do you
plan on not paying your rent?

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,240
You're up to 60,000 yen this month.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,860
We're sorry.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,070
I don't want your
apologies, I want your rent.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,250
The last time I came over, you'd promised to pay <i>this</i> month.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,460
Hand over the rent.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,960
Pretending to be asleep
won't do any good!

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,300
I'm not leaving
until I get the rent.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,640
Um...

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,020
It's a sparrow's tear
in the bucket, but...

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,790
Tattaima hajimete kizuita
I only just noticed

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,460
that I fell in love
Koi ni ochita no da naa

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,080
You are on my mind all day, day, day
24h kimiOkimiOkimiO

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,880
and I can't do anything about it
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen!

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,300
Somehow
Nanka

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,090
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,920
with you
Futari

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,720
you seem different from usual, could it be...
Gikochinai kaiwa masaka

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
Mutual love?
Ryouomoi

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,930
Nah, it's one-sided
Iya kataomoi

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,560
Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

23
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,180
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,110
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,150
This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,780
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kanaa

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,580
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,210
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

29
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,920
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,590
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,260
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation
Yayayacchatta kaiwa kami makuri

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,880
Awkward silence, mmhmmhmhm
Kimazui chinmoku mamimumemo

33
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,800
I want
Kimi no

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,430
to know your feelings
Kimochi shiritai yo

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,350
O-o-one-one-sided love
KakakataOkataomoi

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,430
My first love
Hatsukoi!!

37
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,270
on my normal way to school
Itsumo no tsuugakuro

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,600
glitters brightly
Pikapika hikaru

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,690
I DO fall in love!

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,360
I feel like I can fly in the sky
Sora mo tobesou sa

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,650
O-o-one-one-sided love
KakakataOkataomoi

42
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,700
<i>Number one: Honduras slider.</i>

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,000
<i>Number two:
northern ornate box turtle.</i>

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,670
<i>Number three: red-bellied,
short-necked turtle.</i>

45
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,960
Number two.

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,420
<i>The answer is number three.</i>

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,260
<i>You're all correct.</i>

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,140
Shut up!

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,350
Oh, you're still awake?

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,970
How's your cold?

51
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,350
Mmph hm.

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,350
Then go to school tomorrow.

53
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,230
Don't you have
a test coming up?

54
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,940
Okay.

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,900
You missed three days,

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,900
so be sure to ask your friends about what'll be on the test.

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,490
And about what they
went over in class.

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,490
Okay.

59
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,860
Don't get cocky.

60
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,490
You got a terrible
grade on the last test.

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,570
Are you listening?

62
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,200
Don't you ever stop talking, Mom?

63
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,910
My final exams are...

64
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,370
tomorrow!

65
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,790
Not a Winner

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,210
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 44
Not a Winner

67
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,790
You were late!

68
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,250
Your warning was late!

69
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,210
You couldn't study in bed.

70
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,430
I did! I did it in my sleep!

71
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:20,970
You did?

72
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,380
No!
You did?

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Which is it?

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,180
I'm saying your
warning was too late!

75
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,850
Would you have studied
if I'd warned you?

76
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,220
No.

77
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,980
If you fail, I'll kill you.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,480
Don't sound so serious!

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,230
<i>Super ultra great
delicious wonderful crap.</i>

80
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,420
<i>Well, I've just gotta study.</i>

81
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,550
<i>I've got about ten
hours until school starts.</i>

82
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,550
<i>Fortunately, tomorrow's tests
are English and music!</i>

83
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
<i>I can focus on English.</i>

84
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,140
<i>That's right.</i>

85
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,520
<i>What I need to do now is to
say goodbye to my old self,</i>

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,850
<i>and just concentrate!</i>

87
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,690
<i>To live today without regrets.</i>

88
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,320
<i>To live tomorrow with a smile,</i>

89
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,360
<i>even though I cried yesterday.</i>

90
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,120
<i>No matter how many times I fall,</i>

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,370
<i>I will not give up.</i>

92
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,290
<i>Because I want to
live, always smiling.</i>

93
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,250
<i>Boat headed out to
the distant ocean,</i>

94
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,460
<i>keep on charging
toward that distant light.</i>

95
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>Keep moving forward,
keep moving forward.</i>

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,390
<i>Now, cast off your chains.</i>

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,180
<i>Yukko.</i>

98
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,100
<i>I'm done</i>

99
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
<i>with my poem.</i>

100
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,150
Things we think are cool!

101
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,320
Aw, it's nothing...

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,200
A factory worker's shy smile!

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,160
<i>I'll gamble.</i>

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,870
<i>I don't know what's
on the English exam,</i>

105
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,080
<i>so I have to take my chances!</i>

106
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,250
<i>I'll have to stick with
English vocabulary.</i>

107
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,210
<i>"Attempt."</i>

108
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,460
<i>To try.</i>

109
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,540
<i>"Love."</i>

110
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,130
<i>My love.</i>

111
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,590
<i>"Always."</i>

112
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,800
<i>We've always been apart.</i>

113
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,630
<i>"Confirmation."</i>

114
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,180
<i>Your love.</i>

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,470
<i>"Teleportation."</i>

116
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,970
<i>Leap through time.</i>

117
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,430
<i>Which is why...</i>

118
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,890
<i>"Cosmos."</i>

119
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,560
<i>Through the sky.</i>

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,270
<i>"Midnight submarine."</i>

121
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,900
<i>I want to ride with you.</i>

122
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,940
<i>"Forever", for an eternity.</i>

123
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,610
<i>"Forever", with you.</i>

124
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,900
<i>"Forever", always.</i>

125
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,530
<i>I'm done!</i>

126
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,780
<i>With my poem!</i>

127
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,410
<i>I know! I know!</i>

128
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,870
<i>Studying now won't help!</i>

129
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,080
<i>It's hopeless,
Mom's going to kill me.</i>

130
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,080
<i>Why did I have to get
over my cold </i>today<i>?</i>

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,340
<i>Having a cold is a hundred
times better than dying.</i>

132
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,880
<i>If I only had three more days...</i>

133
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,850
And now...

134
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,980
<i>My plan is perfect!</i>

135
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,480
<i>That's right.</i>

136
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,900
<i>If I don't want to take my exams,</i>

137
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,400
<i>I should just catch another cold!</i>

138
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,280
<i>It hurts, but I know
it'll do the trick.</i>

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,910
<i>Sitting in an icy bath just
after getting over a cold</i>

140
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,540
<i>will definitely make me sick!</i>

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,670
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

142
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,790
<i>I can feel it working!</i>

143
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,260
<i>This is it.</i>

144
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,050
<i>I just have to endure this!</i>

145
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,430
<i>I can do it!</i>

146
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,100
<i>If I can get a fever, I'll be all set.</i>

147
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,770
<i>I'll make it a sure thing by
eating some shaved ice...</i>

148
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,350
<i>turning the air conditioning
up to maximum...</i>

149
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,230
<i>and sleeping on
top of the blanket.</i>

150
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,630
I'm perfectly healthy!

151
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,010
Yukko, wake up.

152
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,920
<i>If that's how it's going to be...</i>

153
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,840
<i>Thermometer!</i>

154
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,590
<i>Match!</i>

155
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,760
<i>Raise the temperature!</i>

156
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,010
Are you up?

157
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,890
Aren't you going to school?

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,850
Yukko.

159
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,770
Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot! Hot!

160
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,060
What are you doing?

161
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,600
I got a fever.

162
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
My cold is back.

163
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,560
What's your temperature?

164
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,150
Uh, um...

165
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
88.8 degrees.

166
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,160
What? Why'd you break it?

167
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,740
It's not broken,
I've really got a cold!

168
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,370
You seem perfectly healthy.

169
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:01,370
It's probably the nice water.

170
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,870
Daiku Power
It's probably the nice water.

171
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,080
Thank you.

172
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,170
I didn't realize that the club
application form's deadline was today.

173
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,920
Our club was nearly disbanded.

174
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Even if you turn in the form,

175
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,850
your club'll still be disbanded if you don't get more members.

176
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,560
Don't worry about that.

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,060
Anyway, I'll buy you some
juice tomorrow as thanks.

178
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,230
You don't have to do that.

179
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,610
There's no need to be shy.

180
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,940
See ya.

181
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,610
On the way home, I'll need to
buy a mixer and an apple orchard.

182
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,400
Yes, sir.

183
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,710
That must be the

I made dumplings
earlier, in the park.

232
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,650
You can have some.

233
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,860
This is...

234
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,150
You must be hungry, so eat up.

Mi...

236
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,410

I see, I see. Thank you.

238
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,420
Why are you crying?

239
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,090
You've always been
so quick to cry.

240
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,340
Well, I'll be in the kitchen.

241
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,090

Hey, hurry and eat them!

245
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,650

It's pretty huge.

265
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,740
Because it's super.

266
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,330
I'll spread this all
over the hallway

267
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,460
and immobilize
Nano and Sakamoto.

268
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,380
You're up to something weird again.

269
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,090
Who'd ever fall for
such an obvious trap?

270
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,920
You did.

271
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,470
I didn't fall for anything!

get me out of here!

273
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,970
I've got places to be!

274
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,560
It'll come off with water.

275
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,350
Then get some water!
Hurry and get some water!

276
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,310
Ah! It's snack time.

277
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,900
LISTEN!

278
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm going to eat my snack,
so you'll have to excuse me.

279
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,030
Stop!

280
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,740
Huh?

281
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,870
Huh? What? Huhwha?

282
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,660
Hey.

283
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,370
What're we gonna do?

284
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,290
This sucks.

285
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,460
Sakamoto, you look like a
cockroach trapped on sticky paper.

286
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,080
This isn't funny!

287
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,500
Besides, you're trapped too!

288
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,290
Huh? Huhwha?

289
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,420
Serves you right!
It's divine retribution.

290
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Huh? That's weird.

291
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,010
You're always up to no good.

292
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,270
Huh? Huhwha?
Sakamoto, what do we do?

293
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,310
Huh? Sakamoto's gone.

294
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,440
Sakamoto? Sakamoto?

295
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,780
Sakamoto!

296
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,710
We can't get it
off without water.

297
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,340
At this rate, I won't get my snack.

298
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,220
I might get hungry
while I'm stuck here.

299
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,010
I might starve to death.

300
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,060
I might die.

301
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,390
<i>I might really die.</i>

302
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,980
I'm home.

303
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,810
It's Nano.

304
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,810
It sure is hot out...

305
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,070
I heard it's 35 degrees outside.

306
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,230
What are you doing?

307
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,320
While I was playing with the glue,

308
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,610
it squirted out.

309
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,320
But if we put water on it...

310
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
But I'm stuck in it, too.

311
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,330
But if we get some water, Nano, Nano...

312
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,040
What? Water?
But if we get some water, Nano, Nano...

313

Yes.

314
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,460
Anyway, get up first.

315
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,710
If you lie in the hall,
your clothes will get...

316
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,760
What is this?

317
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,510
Um...

00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,760

Next,

329
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,280
Guess who.

330
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
Is that you, Professor?

331
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,070
Yup!

332
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,030
What gave me away?

333
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,200
Well, it was obvious.

334
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,660
You're the only one here.

335
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,330
Now it's your turn.

336
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,130
What? Uh, okay...

337
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,420
Guess who.

338
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,710

342
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,760
Yes, you're right.

343
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,680

<i>Wait. I've seen
this problem before.</i>

356
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,890
<i>What was it? I asked
Ms. Sakurai about it.</i>

357
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,770
<i>I think it was...</i>

358
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,350
What is this?

359
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,190
Did you draw this thing that looks like it'd be killed by a Poof spell?

360
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,030
This thing that looks like
it'd be killed by a Poof spell?

361
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,320
<i>Yeah! That killed-by-a-Poof thing!</i>

362
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,780
<i>That doesn't help!</i>

363
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,620
<i>Calm down. Just calm down, Yukko.</i>

364
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,700
<i>If I panic, I won't even be able
to answer the questions I know.</i>

365
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,750
<i>If it's flying, the word must be...</i>

366
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,460
"Fly", I think.

367
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,000
<i>No, no. That seems
too strong for this.</i>

368
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,300
<i>What is this monster doing?</i>

369
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,590
<i>Monster?</i>

370
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,220
<i>This isn't an English test.</i>

371
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,260
<i>It's a logic test.</i>

372
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,720
<i>But this is all I can do right now.</i>

373
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,230
<i>I'll just move on
to the next question.</i>

374
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,190
<i>The same monster is
holding a tennis racket...</i>

375
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,570
<i>which means that the answer to
the previous question isn't "monster"...</i>

376
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,150
<i>What kind of weird trick is this?</i>

377
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,240
<i>I'll erase the previous answer
and start from square one.</i>

378
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,160
<i>My eraser...</i>

379
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,920
<i>...isn't here!</i>

380
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,460
Wh-wh-what am I gonna do?

381
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,380
<i>I'll have to...</i>

382
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,050
<i>Mai!</i>

383
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,930
<i>Everyone should
have such great friends!</i>

384
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,600
<i>A sand eraser?</i>

385
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,520
<i>It'll tear... This thing
will tear the paper!</i>

386
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,480
<i>Hey, I don't have time for this!</i>

387
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,940
Mai, do you have a normal-

388
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,150
<i>She's asleep.</i>

389
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,900
You have ten more minutes.

390
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,070
<i>The time. Time is...</i>

391
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,700
<i>Just calm down.</i>

392
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,120
<i>That's right.</i>

393
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,120
<i>Calm down, and...</i>

394
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,590
<i>feel nothingness.</i>

395
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,590
<i>Nothingness...</i>

396
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,720
The test is over.

397
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,220
What?!

398
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,960
The rain...

399
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,680
My heart...

400
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,950
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

401
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:53,040
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

402
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,380
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

403
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:05,170
When our eyes met, flutteringly... it must be coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au... guuzen da yo ne

404
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:12,010
It's not in me to say this is my first love!
Hatsukoi nante ienai kyara ja nainda mon!

405
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:18,020
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

406
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,280
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

407
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:34,200
Today was fun again, it must be love
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa koi shite da naa

408
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,170
I'm so happy, so happy. Nice to meet you, awakening love.
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashite koigokoro

409
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:49,430
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

410
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:59,480
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

411
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,980
Open

412
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,490
Good morning!

413
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,240
Good morning.

414
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,320
No way! I got a love letter!

415
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,740
No way. Who's it from?

416
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,120
It says it's from
class Q's Tanaka.

417
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,660
Let's go see him.

418
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,920
I'm mud.

419
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,090
I'm a steel ball.

420
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm going to sleep.

421
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm molded while I'm hot. Clang!

422
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,770
