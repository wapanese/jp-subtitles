00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,550
I'd like to do something that has never been witnessed before,

54
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,850
and shall never be witnessed again!

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,310
Domestic violence.

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,860
How was it?

57
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,450
<i>What am I supposed
to say to that?</i>

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,410
It was just like you.

59
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,750
It really was.

60
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,750
Yes, just like you.

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,040
Then next, I'll do something
completely unlike me.

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,470
I tripped!

63
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,480
<i>That was just like her...</i>

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,610

I'm sorry,

68
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,800
but do you think you
could wear this?

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,810
We've got rice cakes!
Come get some!

70
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,640
Sorry, but could
you stop talking?

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,400
Newbie,

72
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,280
Can't you wear
some clothes?

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,530
Are you sulking?!

74
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,290
Newbie,
Part 3

75
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,170
You're not sulking?
So, what is it?

76
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,770
Hey... you can talk now!

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,270
Love-like

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,780

I hope the person to the right gets accepted...

You can do it!
I hope the person below gets accepted!!

00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,370
Yes!

85
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,460
You didn't jump!

86
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,710
Huh? But the bar...

87
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,670
Yeah, but you didn't
jump <i>over</i>  it!

88
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,760
How many times do
I have to teach you?

89
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
The sun's going to set!

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,220
Sorry. I'll try harder next time.

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,220
This time, I'll lower the bar.

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,100
Take your time.

93
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,350
Just be sure you do it
how I taught you, okay?

94
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,100
Okay.

95
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,900
<i>I have to be able to jump
before the next test...</i>

96
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,400
<i>or everyone's going
to laugh at me!</i>

97
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,540
How was that?

98
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,540
You stupid cow!

99
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,170
Why won't you jump
the way I taught you?

100
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,340
Are you messing around?

101
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,880
In my head, it was a
perfect Fosbury Flop.

102
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,470
A perfect Fosbury Flop?

103
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,390
Your form's closer to...

104
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,600
a torpedo!

105
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,600
A human torpedo...

106
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,730
I didn't say that!

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,310
No, I...

108
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,230
I guess I did say that...

109
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,150
No, no, you're just kidding, right?

110
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,490
You don't see it?

111
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,410
Sorry.

112
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,120
Well, I'll stay until you're satisfied.

113
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,250
You always let me copy your homework.

114
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,130
It's my turn to help you!

115
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,420
Let's keep going until you can do it.

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,470
Just take it easy.

117
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,930
First, try to jump as if
you're just stepping over it!

118
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,680
Mio, you can do this!
It's no problem!

119
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,190
<i>It's not like I've suddenly
become nonathletic.</i>

120
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,020
Go! You can do it!

121
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,320
Hey, Mio! We're playing soccer!

122
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,320
<i>I'm as fit as the average person.</i>

123
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,160
<i>But when rules get
involved, I lose control.</i>

124
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
Backwards fall...

125
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,740
Go!

126
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,540
Mio, the other way!
You're doing it in reverse!

127
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,920
<i>But if I do nothing,
nothing will change.</i>

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,260
<i>I'll just stay as I am!</i>

129
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,010
Ready, and...

130
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,350
Mio, not the propeller!
It's a back hip circle!

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,680
<i>I don't care if it's pointless...</i>

132
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,600
<i>I don't care if I don't get results.</i>

133
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,620
<i>There's only one thing I can do...</i>

134
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,040
One, two, three!

135
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,170
Let's give it another try.

136
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,170
<i>For Yukko...</i>

137
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,540
I'm going to take a break.

138
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,170
Okay.

139
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,050
<i>For myself, too!</i>

140
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,770
<i>I won't give up!
If I have to give up...</i>

141
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,110
<i>I'll make sure I've done
everything I could first!</i>

142
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,240
Hard work will always open doors.

143
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,540
This came to be known
as the "Torpedo Jump".

144
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,970
This is a white tiger.

145
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,390
All they do is sleep...

146
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,850
That one's pointing its butt at us.

147
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,310
Yeah.

148
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,360
They're really far away,
too. It's hard to see.

149
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,280
We came all this way to
see them, and it's boring!

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,400
We should be glad
we got to see them.

151
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,450
I guess...

152
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,250
Hooray!

154
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,250
It's raining! We should
bring in the laundry.

155
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,750
Hey, where are you going?

156
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,770
Yay!

157
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,070
Looks like it's too late.

158
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,070
Just get it inside!

159
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,360
It's raining!

160
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,080
Professor, Mr. Sakamoto, I'm home...

161
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,200
It's raining hard, isn't it?

162
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,330
Did you bring in the laundry?

163
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,000
Sakamoto told me to bring it in!

164
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,090
It's true.

165
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,680
Sakamoto really did
tell me to bring it in...

166
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,470
So, you dropped the laundry because Mr. Sakamoto told you to bring it in?

167
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,730
That's not it! Sakamoto
told me to bring it in...

168
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,940
and drop it.

169
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,900
I did not!

170
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,610
That scared me...

171
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,730
What were you talking about, kid?

172
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,730
You told me to do it!

173
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,740
I never told you to drop it.

174
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,240
Did, too!

175
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,280
Did not!

176
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,990
Did, too!

177
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,860
Did not!

178
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,700
Did, too!

179
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,450
Did not!

180
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,200
Did, too!

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,120
Did not!

182
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,040
Did, too!

183
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,490
Did not!

184
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,950
Give me a break...

185
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,120
What?!

186
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,250
Nano... let's sacrifice Sakamoto.
Then everything'll be okay, right?

187
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,460
What's going on?

188
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,380
Forget it. We can just
wash the laundry again.

189
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,640
Oh! Right.

190
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,640
That's right.

191
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,890
But we can never get this day back.

192
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,850
Neither of you gets dinner tonight.

193
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,560
What?

194
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,360
How did I get dragged into this?

195
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,320
But Sakamoto did it!
And I said I'd sacrifice Sakamoto,

196
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,820
so it's okay, right?

197
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,660
Fine. Then I'll take Mr. Sakamoto.

198
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,830
And you won't get any dinner, Professor.

199
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,450
What?

200
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,910
No! Then I'll sacrifice myself!

201
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,040
I dropped it! I'm the
one who got it wet...

202
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,750
<i>What?</i>

203
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,090
Ta-dah! Today's dinner
is omelette rice!

204
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,680
Wow...

205
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,310
The eggs were on sale.

206
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,600
Huh? Do I get to eat today?

207
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,480
Oh! That's right. I completely forgot...

208
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,270
Um, well...

209
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,190
Well, let's just eat today!

210
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,490
Hooray!

211
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,240
No dinner tomorrow.

212
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Lame.

213
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,780
Swim, swim.

214
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,790
Shark, shark, chomp.

215
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,540
What is this?

216
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,480
Mio! Mai! Selamat pagi!

217
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,360
Didn't that self-portrait
sculpture assignment suck?

218
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
What? That's due today?

219
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,830
What's this? Master Mio,
did you forget your homework?

220
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,740
I thought it was due tomorrow.

221
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,540
Mai, did you do it?

222
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,250
Crap.

223
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,420
Mai didn't do hers, either?

224
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,880
What's next, a shower?

225
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,260
It won't just be a shower.

226
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,890
It'll be a natural disaster!

227

Everyday Life

228
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,650
<i>It really did...</i>

229
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,360
<i>...start raining.</i>

230
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,270
What have you done to my temple?

231
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,030
You thieves...

232
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,290
Th-that was close!

233
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,800
It's a curse...

234
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,970
It's an evil spirit.

235
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,810
B-begone...

236
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,560
Leave this temple!

237
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,690
"Let us go."

238
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,570
Is what they thought,
as the autumn rain fell.

Nichijou:
Everyday Life

240
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,700
<i>Please, President...</i>

241
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,410
<i>I'm about to have a match
against Mr. Takasaki.</i>

242
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,200
<i>Can you be our referee?</i>

243
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,500
<i>Referee? You mean for Go-Soccer?</i>

244
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,200
<i>Yes!</i>

245
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,830
<i>If I win, he has to
become our advisor.</i>

246
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,460
<i>I know I can do it!</i>

247
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,800
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

248
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,460
<i>It's okay.</i>

249
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,760
<i>The Go-Soccer rulebook I lent you</i>

250
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,220
<i>has everything you need to know.</i>

251
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,970
<i>I know it's my fault for
not reading the guide,</i>

252
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,650
<i>but I have no idea what
these two are doing...</i>

253
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,730
<i>This is Go-Soccer?</i>

254
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,980
You wouldn't understand even if you'd read the rulebook.

255
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,990
Ogi?

256
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,490
Neither is observing the rules.

257
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,700
Their high-level play has
no regard for theory.

258
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,500
If that outstretched hand
is the leg of a Go board,

259
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,710
that stance is the stone.

260
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,000
It may appear normal at first glance,

261
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,250
but that ball between
his feet is an anomaly.

262
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,170
It's just speculation,
but I believe these two...

263
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,470
are trying to achieve brilliance!

264
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,220
<i>I have no idea what
he's talking about.</i>

265
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,970
There they go!

266
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,690
Oh, no!

267
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,610
<i>Birabudo!</i>

268
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,360
Ogi, what does that...

269
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,070
Quiet!

270
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,660
Can't you see how the
air flows between them?

271
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,330
One of them...

272
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,500
might even die.

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,590
<i>What's going on?</i>

274
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,380
I haven't seen such
high-level play in a long time.

275
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,760
No wonder the wind screams...

276
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,350
No! That stance!

277
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,260
Could it be?

278
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,180
Would he really use that move
in an unofficial match?

279
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,690
Is he out of his mind?

280
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,940
I cannot allow this to happen...

281
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,400
Father, I must do it!

282
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,070
All in the name of justice...

283
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,830
I must become a shining star!

284
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,120
<i>Ogi Forbidden Technique...</i>

285
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,630
<i>Ogi Star!</i>

286
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,270
This is a <i>final rabudo</i>!

287
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,780
Not bad...

288
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,280
You, too, teacher.

289
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,280
<i>Unbelievable...</i>

290
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,210
<i>When I founded this club,
I didn't give it much thought.</i>

291
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,540
<i>Man...</i>

292
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,790
<i>this is unbelievable.</i>

293
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:46,360

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,300

305
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,340
I break when no one sees me.

306
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,420
No matter how many times
you step on me, you won't kill me!

307
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm clay.

308
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,890
Show some respect!

309
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,600
Today, I'll change into
various forms again,

310
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
to battle the children!

311
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,510
