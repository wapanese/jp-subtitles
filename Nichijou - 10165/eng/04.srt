Lately, our school's
morality has been in decline.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,860
I'd like to ask you, as a student adviser,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,570
to crack down on this behavior.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:13,990
Yes, sir!

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,660
I-I'll do my best!

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,760

I only just noticed

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,390
that I fell in love

You are on my mind all day, day, day

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,850
and I can't do anything about it

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,270
Somehow

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,060
while having an awkward conversation

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,690
you seem different from usual, could it be...

Nah, it's one-sided

00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,480
Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,110
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,030
My train of thought slips into chaos

This is the first time it has happened to me,

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,750
maybe I have a fever?

And I instantly blushed a deep red

N-n-no way! My hands are trembling

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,520
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,230
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation

<i>That's right. I became a student
adviser to change myself.</i>

38
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,510
<i>I have to correct their behavior.</i>

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,940
<i>Unbelievable! I don't believe it!</i>

40
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,610
<i>No. I must not back down!</i>

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,320
E-excuse me...

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,740
What is it, madam?

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Well, you see...

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,910
I-I just think... that it's poor
manners to eat while walking...

45
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,290
Please excuse me.

46
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,000
Since I skipped breakfast,

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,380
my stomach has been growling.

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,380
I'll put this away immediately.

49
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,800
Please excuse me.

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,590
I-I'm sorry. It's no big deal.

51
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,840
As long as you understand...

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,010
<i>Good.</i>

53
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,850
<i>If I just talk to them,
the students will understand.</i>

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,770
Tell the chef...

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,820
it was delicious!

56
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,740
What was delicious?

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,200
Why are you shouting in the hallway?

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,950
Why don't you think about
common decency for once?

59
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,420
U-uh, y-you shouldn't...
bring that to school...

60
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,250
Misato, come on.

61
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,290
Okay.

62
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,840
Sasahara!

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,130
I need to talk to you at lunch,

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,720
so you'd better be in the classroom!

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
<i>School morality might
just be in decline...</i>

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
Excuse me.

67
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,890
Tachibana Misato means no harm.

68
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,810
Please forgive her.

69
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,690
All right. Excuse me.

70
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,940
U-um...

71
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,940
What is that frilly
thing around your neck?

72
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,200
Oh, this?

73
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,160
Yes. It's sort of cute...

74
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,120
Our everyday lives may, in fact,

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,960
be a series of miracles.

76
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,090
They just may be...

77
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,060
So what is that frilly thing?

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
Well said.

79
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,740
I shall see you in class, madam.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,220
<i>Thank you.</i>

Excuse me, Nakanojo.

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,270
Yes. What is it?

84
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,820
Yes, well, you see...

85
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,950
Don't you think that hairstyle's just... a little too much for school?

86
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,080
No, just a little.
Just a little, I think...

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,450
It doesn't...

88
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,210
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Could you repeat that?

89
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,250
It doesn't grow...

90
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,170
It doesn't grow on the sides!

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,860
Nano, what's this?

97
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,360
It's a green plum.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,200
I'm thinking of pickling
some plums myself this year.

99
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,410
Pickled plums are sour.

100
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,370
Plums are good for you.

101
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,370
If you put them in rice balls,

102
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,380
they'll keep the rice from going bad.

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,590
Nano!

104
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,590
No.

105
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,510
I haven't said anything yet!

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,180
We just bought a lot of snacks recently.

107
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,980
Eat those first. Once
we run out, we'll buy more...

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,770
Professor...

109
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,150
I said no. Today, that cat... uh...

110
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,610
Sakamoto.

111
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,910
Yes. I need to buy Mr. Sakamoto's dinner, so your snacks...

112
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,080
It's huge.

113
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Excuse me...

114
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,790
May I help you?

115
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,420
Wh-what is this?

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,550
Oh, the snowman.
We just got it today.

117
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,340
You're welcome to buy it.

118
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,350
Snack?

119
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,470
Maybe it's for shaved ice?

120
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,680
It's cold.

121
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,860
It's cheap...

122
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,980
You're buying it?

123
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,900
What? N-no, I'm just looking.

124
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,700
It's a snowman.

125
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,240
I want it.

126
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,200
Hey, you.

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,080
Yes?

128
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,080
If you're not buying
that, hand it over.

129
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,130
I-I'm buying it.

130
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,760
You get to buy what you want,

131
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,510
but you won't let
me buy what I want...

132
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,850
No, this is...

133
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,180
You get to buy what you want,

134
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,190
so I should get to
buy what I want!

135
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,150
I want it! I want it! I want it!

136
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,440
Fine, fine. But just one.

137
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,030
Really?

138
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,240
I love you, Nano.

139
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,910
Which is why you bought that thing.

140
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,710
Yes. It's cute and refreshing.

141
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,920
Professor, it's ready.

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,010
Okay.

143
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,680
Nano, more!

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Okay.

145
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
I can't believe you two...

146
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,860
So, where's my dinner?

147
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,490
<i>Shaved ice...</i>

148
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,790
<i>I refuse to eat shaved ice for dinner.</i>

149
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,880
First comes rock! Then comes paper.

150
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,630
You can't throw all of them...

151
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,380
rock, paper, scissors!

152
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,020
It's flying.

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,810

Okay! The test is over.

158

Oh my god!

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,800

161

When you try to consider
the wishes of others,

162
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,360
there are so many other people that it's easy to get confused.

163
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,360
However, when you
focus on your own wishes,

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,280
they seem much easier to grasp.

165
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,290
All that's left is to pray to a god.

166
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,130
So, I pray to that god,
please grant my wishes.

167

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,270
Oh, Mr. Sakamoto.
They're pickled plums.

179
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,990
Don't eat them.
They're not ready yet.

180
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,200
I'll use this to
play with Sakamoto.

181
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,240
It's a green foxtail.
I'll use this to
play with Sakamoto.

182
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,780
It's a green foxtail.

183
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,410
Sakamoto! Sakamoto...

184
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,710
Child, I told you to say "Mr."!

185
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,750
Oh, right. Sorry, Sakamoto.

186
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,380
Are you making fun of me?

187
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,260
Whoops. I forgot...

188
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Sorry, Sakamoto.

189
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,050
You're doing this
on purpose, aren't you?

190
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,690
I'm going shopping.

191
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,770
See you later.

192
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,900
You girls haven't
been raised properly.

193
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,570
Sorry, Sakamoto.
It's not on purpose.

194
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,700
Don't just call me Sakamoto!

195
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,950
Here, Sakamoto. Have some gum.

196
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,580
How many times do
I have to tell you?

197
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,620
And who would give
gum to a cat, you fool?

198
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,880
Cut it out!

199
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,180
Sorry...

200
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,340
Listen! Like I said,

201
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,850
I'm older than you.

202
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,600
Using "Mr." when referring
to your elders is... um...

203
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,150
It's... you know...

204
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,410
It's... um... You

205
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,450
What?

206
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,240
Can I go pee?

207
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,410
Fine! Go!

208
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,080
Pee!

209
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,380
<i>You're taking it with you...</i>

210
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,720
<i>As far as I can tell, only
those two kids live here...</i>

211
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,810
<i>I can see why they're
so poorly educated.</i>

212
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,400
<i>Which makes me
the oldest in this house.</i>

213
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,570
<i>I suppose I have no choice.</i>

214
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,990
<i>It won't be easy, but I'll
have to act as their parent.</i>

215
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,700
<i>Geez, I've been taken in
by such a ridiculous family.</i>

216
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,250
<i>I can't believe how fun this is!</i>

217
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,840
Sakamoto, what're you doing?

218
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,550
<i>Oh, no!</i>

219
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,800
<i>If she finds out I was
playing with an eraser,</i>

220
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
<i>she'll lose respect for me...</i>

221
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,470
<i>Respect...</i>

222
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,940
I was just taking a nap.

223
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:22,980
Cats sure do sleep a lot.
I was just taking a nap.

224
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,900
Cats sure do sleep a lot.

225
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,200
That's how it is.

226
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,070
Yeah, that's how it is.

227
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,200
I can't teach you too much at once,

228
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,660
but you can start by learning to...

229
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,710
respect... your elders!

230
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,420
<i>Oh, man! This is so fun!</i>

231
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,590
Sakamoto! Again! Again!

232
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,510
Sakamoto! Sakamoto, over here!

233
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,380
No, this is wrong! That was just...

234
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,430
Didn't I tell you to say "Mr."?

235
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,300
Sakamoto!

236
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,890
Didn't I tell you to say "Mr."?

237
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm home.

238
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Home run!

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,900
Nakanojo

240
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,550
Mom!

241
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,310
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 18

242
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,520
Green light...

243
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,610
Red light!

244
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,530
Green light...

245
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,370
<i>Mai made a confusing joke again.</i>

246
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,250
<i>I guess I should play along.</i>

247
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,040
Mai! Isn't that <i>on the book</i>?

248
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,550
Yukko, don't ever make
a joke like that again.

249
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,470
If you do...

250
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,310
you'll make my jokes look bad.

251
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,150
It's like, you know,

252
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm at that age when English
just pops out of my mouth.

253
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,610
But that <i>on the book</i>,

254
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,150
I just didn't know if you
were making a joke or not.

255
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,520
And, you know,
I just couldn't resist...

256
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,240
You couldn't understand?

257
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,290
Are you serious?

258
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,040
Of all people...

259
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,300
I thought you would understand.

260
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,260
Oh, wow. I didn't realize
you thought of me that way.

261
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,140
I'm glad you trust me, though...

262
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
Trust you?

263
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,150
Yeah...

264
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
We're not friends,

265
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,190
so let's not talk about trust, okay?

266
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,830
Sisters don't need words
to understand each other.

267
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,130
Mai...

268
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,260
Oh, Mai! Sisters can use words, too!

269
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,930
<i>Mai...</i>

270
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,770
Could you stop touching me?

271
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,060
Huh? Oh, sorry...

272
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,150
Stop it.

273
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,990
If you do that, I...

274
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,160
I might like you even more...

275
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,910
What?

276
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,050
Who cares if you
like me more? Right?

277
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,840
We're sisters! Sisters!

278
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,010
That's not what I meant.

279
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,300
I know we're the same gender,

280
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,060
but I still see you as
someone of the opposite sex.

281
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,100
Sorry,

282
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,900
I don't know how to say it...

283
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,990
<i>W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-what?</i>

284
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,660
<i>What the heck?</i>

285
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
<i>I knew something was up today!</i>

286
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,120
<i>Sh-she's talking a
lot more than normal,</i>

287
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,580
<i>and she even suggested
that we go somewhere alone!</i>

288
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,590
<i>Was that all so she could say this?</i>

289
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,260
<i>How long has she...</i>

290
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,390
<i>How long has she been...</i>

291
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,510
U-u-um, M-Mai?

292
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,400
W-well, um... I'm not sure
I really understand, but...

293
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,360
Don't you think we're a little young?

294
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,530
I mean, we're still in high school...

295
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,280
I was joking.

296
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,370
<i>Super-ultra, great,
delicious, wonderful...</i>

297
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,660
<i>incomprehensible!</i>

298
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,210
Don't do stuff like that!

299
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,290
I almost believed you!

300
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,000
I see...

301
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,760
You're quick to catch on,

302
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,090
so I thought you'd get it.

303
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,180
Oh? I guess I got it a little.

304
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,310
You're lying, aren't you?

305
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,770
I'm not lying, it's just...

306
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,400
I was thinking.

307
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,690
The gears were turning...

308
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,820
I mean, there was clearly something wrong with what you were saying.

309
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,280
Didn't you say you believed it?

310
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,200
I hate being lied to
more than anything.

311
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
Sorry...

312
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,040
I was joking again.

313
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,960
How am I supposed to tell?!

314
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,130
You didn't notice?

315
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,010
There was one more joke.

316
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,970
I didn't notice! What was it?

317
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,220
When I said you were
quick to catch on.

318
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,060
You were supposed
to say you weren't.

319
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,980
That was iiiiiiiiiit?!

320
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,860
That one's pretty easy to understand.

321
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:10,930
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

322
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:17,020
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

323
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:23,360
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

324
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,160
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

325
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,000
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

326
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,040
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

327
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,300
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

328
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:58,270
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

329
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,150
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

330
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,450
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

331
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:23,500
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

332
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,130
It's been forty years.
This is the apartment building.

333
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,680
Try writing the word "housewife".

334
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,390
I think you'll find an unbelievable amount of sexiness to it.

335
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:35,470
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 5.

336
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,350
Narration:    Ohara Noriko

337
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,020
Don't miss it.
