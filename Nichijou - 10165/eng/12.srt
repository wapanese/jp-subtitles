Man, it's hot... It's so hot!

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,620
Tanaka, you've been
saying "hot" this whole time.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,250
It's already hot,

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,000
and pointing out how hot
it is just makes it feel hotter.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,710
So, I forbid you from saying "hot".

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,720
Okay, okay.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,430
It's blistering!

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,810
It's blistering, isn't it?

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,270
Just kidding!

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,600
But it's <i>really</i>
blistering, huh?

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,770
It's blistering!

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,770
Blistering!

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,100
Super blistering!

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,940
<i>I guess I'll have to hit him.</i>

My train of thought slips into chaos

This is the first time it has happened to me,

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,790
maybe I have a fever?

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,540
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,170
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,920
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,550
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

I st-st-stuttered through our conversation

<i>Today's homework...</i>

69
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,810

aliens invade our class...

You forgot to do it again?

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,790
Don't insult me!

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,700
I did my homework,
but I forgot to bring it!

76
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,410
I wasn't insulting you.

77
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,080
You mean the literature
worksheet, right?

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,710
Maybe it got stuck between
something in your bag.

79
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,300
Why not double check?

80
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,420
I already looked
a bunch of times.

81
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,340

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,970
Oh?

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,760
Oh!

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,970
Oh...

a worksheet in the podium.

90
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,620
No way! You found one?

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,790
<i>Damn it!</i>

92
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,130
<i>Damn it!</i>

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,630
You're going back for it?

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,840
You'll never make it in time!

96
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,220
I know... but I'm still going!

97

Some new drinks came out,

122
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,620
so I was thinking
about which one to buy!

123
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,370
I see.

124
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,080
Perhaps this oneâ€”

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,040
Why would I listen to you?

126
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,420
If it doesn't suit your taste,

127
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,800
perhaps you should
purchase the other one.

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,180
Please excuse me.

129
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,100
It's not like I bought this one just because you recommended it!

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,220
<i>But I only have 500 yen.</i>

137
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,300
<i>I wonder if it's enough.</i>

138
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,600
Just 5,000,000 yen per shot.

139
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,180
<i>Lucky me, I have

<i>I wanted to get

<i>but I came here today for this.</i>

142

<i>They only have
caramel and eggplant.</i>

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,280
Um, is this everything?

144
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,160

145
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,620

off with the expensive ones!

<i>Expensive ones?</i>

151
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,770
Start with something
within your reach!

152
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,190
<i>Within my reach?</i>

153
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,320
<i>The only other choice is caramel!</i>

154
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,080
Close!

155
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,130
<i>The caramel must
be glued down, too.</i>

156
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,420
A few more millimeters,
and you would've had it.

157
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,430
Miss, you're pretty good at this.

C'mon what's
with the long face?

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,400
You don't think I've
rigged the game, do you?

We might be stingy,

165
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,330
<i>No, you've definitely
done something to this!</i>

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,350
What is that?!

167
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,520
Hey, hey, look at that!

168
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,650
There's a nail...
I can see the nail!

169
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,900
Wouldn't that
make this rigged?

170
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,410
Why don't you say anything?

171
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,370
And how could you do this?

172
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,250
You were so lively
until just a minute ago!

173
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,040
You must have rigged
the caramel, too!

174
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,920
Why are you pretending to be asleep?

175
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,880
I only have one shot left.
What am I supposed to aim for?

176
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,790
Don't come back again.

177
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,500
<i>What the hell?</i>

178
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,500
Things we think are cool!

179
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,220
Aioi

180
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Mio! Ready?

181
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,320
Nice catch!

182
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,900
Aioi

183
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,990
Oh! SuperBall!
Aioi

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,750
Things we think are cool!

185
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,890
Shoot, so close!

186
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,460
Wow!

187
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,710
Oh! Slipstream!

188
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,680
Thanks.

189
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,100
This old amusement park
is a lot of fun, isn't it?

190
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,350
I'm glad we came.

191
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm getting some juice,
so can I have my wallet?

192
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,940
Oh, right.

193
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm holding it for you.

194
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,860
Yeah, thanks.

195
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,450
If I had it, I'd lose it.

196
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,410
Yeah, you're right.

197
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,950
Huh?

198
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:35,660
Wh-what? What?

199
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,830
I thought it was in here...

200
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,010
It appears that I've
dropped your wallet.

202
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,310
Hey, it might be at
the lost and found!

203
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,400
How much was in it?

204
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,940
4,016 yen.

205
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,400
That's specific...

206
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,780
Lost and Found

207
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,620
It's a brown wallet,
with a snake skin inside.

208
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,830
Here it is.

209
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,120
I'm glad they had it.

210
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,840
I know, right? For a while
there, I was worried.

211
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,050
The following person is lost.

212
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,010
A girl wearing a denim shirt
tucked into denim shorts

213
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,850
with a denim hat is
looking for her mother.

214
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,270
If you have any information,

215
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,900
please contact the
lost persons center.

216
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,260
I really don't like haunted houses.

217
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,890
There it is!

218
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,270
Say "cheese".

219
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,050
Coffee Shop
Daiku-ya

220
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,060
Three lattes for
takeout. Is that all?

221
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,440
Oh, um...

222
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,940
Could I also get this,
this, and this, please?

223
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,360
Izumi

224
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,860
Uh, excuse me.

225
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,280
Could you give me a name, please?

226
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,570
It's Sakurai.

227
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,490
That's not the name I meant...

228
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,080
Oh, right. Sorry.

229
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,080
It's Izumi. I'm Sakurai Izumi.

230
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,500
Uh, I wasn't asking because
you gave me your surname.

231
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,000
People always tell me that both
of my names sound like surnames...

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,470
Actually, I was asking
about the product name.

233
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,510
The product name?
What do you mean?

234
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,010
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

235
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,230
Oh, um... I'm sorry...

236
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,230
Family Restaurant

237
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,230
Ah, that was delicious...

238
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,690
Chopstick Stand
Ah, that was delicious...

239
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,280
I ate a ton.
Chopstick Stand

240
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,030
Now we just wait for dessert
to make its appearance.

241
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,280
Right.

242
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,790
Oh! Me too.

243
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,220
I did it!

244
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,940
Me, too.

245
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,990
As amazing as always, Mai!

246
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,950
What about you, Yukko?
Are you finished?

247
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,820
Huh?

248
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,450
A crane?

249
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,290
Nano, look!

250
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:49,420
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 52

251
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,750
Ta-dah.

252
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,510
I stuck one on myself, too.

253
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,760
Now we match.

254
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,180
You're right.

255
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,470
I'm you for a day,

256
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,560
so whatever you do,
don't call me Professor.

257
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Got it, Nano.

258
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
That was quick!

259
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
Done already, Professor?

260
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,690
Nano, you just
called me Professor.

261
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,490
Huh? But didn't you just
take off your key?

262
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,660
I'm just taking a break!

263
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,120
Today, I'm Nano.

264
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,500
Okay.

265
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,340
Professor... I mean,

266
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,800
Nano, would you
like to play a game?

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,390
Okay! What are we doing?

268
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,180
You'll be me, and I'll be you.

269
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,390
We'll trade roles.

270
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,770
I'll play!

271
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,650
Okay, Professor... I mean,

272
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,650
Nano, put on your key.

273
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,480
Okay!

274
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,740
And since I'm the professor,
let's remove my key.

275
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,320
Not gonna happen.

276
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,950
What do you want to play?

277
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,160
How about cards?

278
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,540
This snack is delicious.

279
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,090
I was saving that!

280
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,380
Right now...

281
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,260
I'm...

282
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,380
the professor.

283
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,350
I don't understand!

284
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,980
I'll be you, but if you're
me, you'll eat my snacks,

285
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,140
so just be you!

286
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,190
Well, now that I'm Nano again,

287
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,780
I'll go grocery
shopping for dinner.

288
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,990
I'll go, too!

289
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,490
I'm not buying any snacks.

290
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,790
I want shark chocolate
and strawberry juice.

291
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,660
I'm not buying those.

292
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,410
Buy them.

293
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,040
No.

294
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,210
Hey, don't forget my food.

295
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,800
The Shinonome household passed
another peaceful day.

296
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,300
Killing Time

297
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,600
If you use English
from here on, you lose.

298
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,890
<i>Okay.</i>

299
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,270
Mio, you just used English.

300
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,280
You didn't say
<i>start</i>, so I'm <i>safe</i>.

301
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,610
I guess I should use
a bunch of English

302
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,570
before I say to <i>start</i>.

303
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,910
You know a bunch of English?

304
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,590
<i>Okay.</i>

305
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,220
Short Thoughts

306
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,170
Bubbly, carbonated drinks
make you feel awake.

307
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Unintentional

308
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,430
I fell asleep.

309
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,730
It looks like Sleeping Beauty
woke up without a kiss.

310
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,940
How?

311
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,950
What do you mean?

312
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,930
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

313
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,980
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

314
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:23,360
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

315
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,110
When our eyes met, flutteringly... it must be coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au... guuzen da yo ne

316
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,000
It's not in me to say this is my first love!
Hatsukoi nante ienai kyara ja nainda mon!

317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,960
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

318
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,260
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

319
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:58,180
Today was fun again, it must be love
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa koi shite da naa

320
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:07,150
I'm so happy, so happy. Nice to meet you, awakening love.
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashite koigokoro

321
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,410
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

322
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:23,420
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

323
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,720
Welcome home,
master. I'm cider.

324
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,220
I'll enchant these bubbles

325
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,970
with a spell to make me delicious...

326
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,510
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 13.

327
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,890

328
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,020
Don't miss it.
