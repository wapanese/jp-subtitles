00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,070
Hey, wasn't Sasahara sleeping?

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,570
Yeah, he was.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,360
His arms were still
perfectly crossed.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,660
Misato, why don't
you go wake him?

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,320
What?

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,660
Sasahara forgot we're
changing classrooms.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,580
Wh-what are you
trying to say?

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,040
Why can't we just leave him?

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,410
I'd feel sorry for him...

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,750
Aren't you childhood friends?

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,500
Go on, already.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Besides, Sasahara's probably
alone in the classroom right now.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,420
Huh? Wh-what...

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,260
We'll catch you later.

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,590
Good luck!

16
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,970
Hey, wait!

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,720
Why do <i>I</i>  have do this for him?

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,430
So what if we're childhood...

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,980
<i>Why don't you confess
your love to Sasahara?</i>

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,820
The best friendship, everything is perfect!
joujou yuujou! banji maji kaichou!

Why are you sleeping when we have to change classrooms?

65
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,200
Ah, Tachibana Misato.

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,120
G-gather up
your textbooks!

67
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,600
I see...

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,520
I had merely intended to
rest my eyes for a moment,

69
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,600
but I fell into a deep slumber.

70
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,270
Just hurry up...

71
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,270
If we show up late together,
people will get the wrong idea.

72
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,360
The wrong idea? About what?

73
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,530
Sh-shut up!

Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 106

75
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,370
N-no! I mean, those just
happened to be there...

76
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,410
It's your fault for taking so long.

77
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,870
Tachibana Misato.

78
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,750
Your hand is bleeding.

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,420
Wh-why are you acting so nice?

80
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,430
Shouldn't you be more worried
about your glasses than my hand?

81
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,300
Why? Glasses feel no pain
when they're broken,

82
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,720
but hands feel pain
when they're cut.

83
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,650
Wh-what are you talking
about? That's obvious!

84
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,480
You think you're clever?

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,280
Fortunately, one of the
lenses is still intact.

86
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,820
These glasses are just
like an old veteran.

87
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,080
What a frail veteran...

88
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,500
So frail.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,180
Let's go.

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,510
Tachibana Misato...

91
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,100
I know!

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,970
I know it was my fault.

93
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,810
Give Walking
a Chance
I still don't think it's cool, so...

94
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,110
I still don't think it's cool, so...

95
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Exactly. Then...

96
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,530
<i>They're staring at us!
I'm dying... I'm dying!</i>

97
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,040
<i>I'm so embarrassed, I could die!</i>

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,700
<i>But I broke his glasses,</i>

99
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,790
<i>so I have to be
Sasahara's eyes.</i>

100
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,130
<i>It's okay... It's okay.</i>

101
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,290
<i>If I explain that I broke his glasses,</i>

102
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,800
<i>everyone will understand
that I'm just helping him.</i>

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,710
<i>That's all.</i>

104
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,890
<i>It's just my volunteer spirit that's
making me act as your eyes for the day.</i>

105
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,890
Tachibana Misato.

106
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,890
Yes?

107
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,350
Before we arrive at the classroom, I'd like to visit the restroom.

108
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,140
What? The r-restroom...

109
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,100
You can't mean the men's room!

110
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,690
Indeed.

111
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,150
<i>There's an obstacle already...</i>

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,900
<i>But it </i>is<i> my fault.</i>

113
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,360
<i>Overcoming this will
deepen our relationship.</i>

114
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,700
Fine! I'll go with you!

115
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,620
Why?

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,830
Because your glasses are broken!

117
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,450
So?

118
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,830
Jeez, you're so slow!

119
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,080
You can't see,

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,210
so I'm acting as your
eyes for the day!

121
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
These are just for show.

122
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,050
Don't get the wrong idea!

123
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,100
I just tried to squish a bug that
happened to be on your right arm!

124
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,100
It's beautiful out today.

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,590

126
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,750
U-uh, there's a place with
spicy curry in Kamakura!

127
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,500
Curry
U-uh, there's a place with
spicy curry in Kamakura!

128
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,710
Ah, yes.
Curry

129
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,460
Ah, yes.

130
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Ms. Sakurai, how spicy
do you like your curry?

131
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,340
Um, uh...

132
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,920
With zero spice.

133
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,590
M-me, too!

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,650

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,190

139
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,620
It's like, uh, you know!

140
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,620
In baseball, you never
know what's gonna happen!

141
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,450
That's why it's fun!

142
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,620
<i>In baseball, you never
know what's gonna happen...</i>

143
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,540
Anyway, she might not
even be his girlfriend.

144
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,630
Right, Nano?

145
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,630
Huh? Yes, that's true!

146
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,380

<i>Sasahara...</i>

150
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,470
Anyway, let's go back, Mio.

151
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,890
Mio!

152
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,520
Naganohara!

153
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,060
Nano, go to Room LL
and distract the teacher!

154
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,690
Right!

155
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,110
Mio, wait!

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,990

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:59,700
Mio!

167
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,830
I'm getting off.

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,950
Damn it!

176
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,160
<i>O-Mio!</i>

177
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,630
<i>O-Mio...</i>

178
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,450
Thanks...

179
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,830
Mio! Mio, are you okay?

180
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,050
Somehow.

181
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,220
I'm tired.

182
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,890
Mio.

183
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,890
Where is he?

184
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,940
Over here! Lil' Ma!

185
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,480
Osamu...

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,150
Oh, good. He's all right...

187
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,360
Are you okay?

188
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,650
Yeah, I think.

189
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
This person rescued me.

190
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,860
Y-you girls!

191
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,030
From that one time!

192
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,740
You girls should know that you
were interfering with police duties,

193
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,450
and it's a serious offense!

194
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,660
You girls? You mean me, too?

195
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,960
Normally, I'd contact
your school, but...

196
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,260
well, considering what
you did, I'll let it slide.

197
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,590
Really?

198
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,930
There you are...

199
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,600
I've finally found
you, pig-tailed girl.

200
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,520
When I saw your shadow
boxing, I realized something...

201
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,230
Well?

202
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,820
Would you like to...

203
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,530
take on the world with boxing?

204
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,580
Thief! Thief!

205
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,700
I've got to go!

206
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,710
Stop by the station later.

207
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,120
I'll give you a schedule
for the commendation!

208
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,630
You can have this.

209
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,300
Okay...

210
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,260
Osamu, it's okay, right?

211
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,300
Of course!

212
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,510
Why not come by my gym,
once things settle down?

213
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,470
We'll talk then.

214
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,140
Mio! Your English
textbook disappeared!

215
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,570
Mio?

216
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,610
<i>I got rejected before
I even confessed...</i>

217
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,780
<i>saved a kid while running...</i>

218
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,490
<i>received a commendation and a kite...</i>

219
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,450
<i>and got scouted by a boxer.</i>

220
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,040
<i>I guess you never know
what's gonna happen.</i>

221
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,750
It's just like you said, Yukko.

222
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,170
You never know
what's gonna happen...

223
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,250
that's why it's fun.

224
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,800
That's baseball, right?

225
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Huh? What do you mean?

226
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,510
See?

227
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,100
Short Thoughts

228
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,980
Red bean soup is...
I realized that daydreaming is free.

229
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,030
<i>Shoot, I lost sight of her.</i>

230
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,080
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 108
<i>Shoot, I lost sight of her.</i>

231
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,500
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 108

232
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,460
<i>I was watching
closely from school,</i>

233
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,710
<i>but I looked away for a
second, and she disappeared.</i>

234
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,220
<i>How unbelievably exceptional...</i>

235
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,390
<i>I must know your
secrets, Shinonome Nano.</i>

236
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,770
<i>I've come this far.</i>

237
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,140
<i>Should I look for something
that could be her home?</i>

238
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,690
<i>I guess tracking her too
far might be dangerous.</i>

239
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,900
<i>I'll give up for the day,
and follow her again tomorrow.</i>

240
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,450
<i>It's in plain sight!</i>

241
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,660
<i>I've already found her.</i>

242
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,200
<i>This has been my first stroke of luck since I began pursuing Shinonome.</i>

243
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,040
<i>No, "luck" doesn't
begin to describe it.</i>

244
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,330
<i>It's, um, what do you call it?</i>

245
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,460
<i>Well, whatever!</i>

246
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,840
<i>Why am I getting so worked up?</i>

247
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,420
<i>I wish to enter immediately
and see the laboratory.</i>

248
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,220
<i>I wish to see
Shinonome's creator.</i>

249
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,720
<i>I wish to steal their blueprints!</i>

250
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,760
<i>All this anticipation is making
my heart pound like a stampede!</i>

251
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,730
<i>Be still, my inner
cowboy, Bill Watts!</i>

252
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,650
<i>The home of Shinonome's
creator may contain traps.</i>

253
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,070
<i>I must approach cautiously.</i>

254
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,440
<i>I know... I'll just take a peek today.</i>

255
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,530
May I help you?

256
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,490
Guinea!

257
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,240
<i>Oh, no! A surveillance bot found me.</i>

258
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,160
<i>It looks rather cheap,</i>

259
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,330
<i>but it was made with the same
advanced technology as Shinonome.</i>

260
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,670
<i>I have to be careful.</i>

261
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,750
<i>I need to show it
I won't resist...</i>

262
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,590
Oh, Ms. Nakamura.

263
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,380
Guinea!

264
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,960
Guidance Counselor's Office

265
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,180
I heard last week that you
carried an injured old lady

266
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,840
to the hospital with your goat.

267
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,800
I did.

268
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,260
Did you predict that an old lady would be
injured and decide to ride to school on a goat?

269
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,480
Say what you will.

270
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,180
For now it's as you say.

271
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,870
Here you are.

272
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,120
<i>I was petrified.</i>

273
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,790
<i>I'm thrilled to have
accessed her home,</i>

274
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,750
<i>but I mustn't forget my situation.</i>

275
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,130
<i>She must be devising
a way to trick me.</i>

276
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,710
<i>For example, this tea...</i>

277
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
<i>It probably contains an
amnesia-inducing drug.</i>

278
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,600
<i>And eyes are watching me
from somewhere in this room.</i>

279
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,430
<i>Wh-wh-wh-what is that?</i>

280
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,890
<i>Its form is obviously bizarre!</i>

281
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,360
<i>It looks haphazardly placed, but it doesn't seem entirely harmless...</i>

282
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,280
<i>If I'm not careful, it'll get me!</i>

283
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,740
What's wrong?

284
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,120
Sorry! It's nothing!

285
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,370
<i>I drank it.</i>

286
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,580
<i>Oh, no! I can't believe I...</i>

287
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,960
Was it too hot?
<i>Oh, no! I can't believe I...</i>

288
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,710
<i>Oh, no! I can't believe I...</i>

289
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,290
<i>If she's going to
catch me anyway...</i>

290
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,090
Allow me to be direct...

291
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,460
Huh? Uh, all right.

292
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,220
I've come to learn more
about you, Shinonome!

293
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,590
What?

294
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,640
What?

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,470
I'd like to see the
real you! Is that okay?

296
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,770
Um, well... I think that's
an individual decision!

297
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,650
It's not normal
for girls to date,

298
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,690
and I think it's best to
stick with what's normal.

299
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,860
Don't be foolish!
That's not what I meant!

300
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,030
What are you thinking?

301
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,660
You're rather embarrassing, aren't you?

302
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,780
Sorry! I'm sorry!

303
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,990
I want to know more about...

304
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
Nano.

305
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,000
Professor!

306
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,500
What?

307
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,870
Nano, I finished my snacks.

308
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,620
<i>Did she just say professor?
Nano, I finished my snacks.</i>

309
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:41,960
Nano, I finished my snacks.

310
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,500
<i>No... No, no, no.</i>

311
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,460
You can't have any
more until tomorrow.

312
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,670
<i>I must have misheard her.
You can't have any
more until tomorrow.</i>

313
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:44,750
<i>I must have misheard her.</i>

314
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,590
What?
<i>I must have misheard her.</i>

315
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,670
What?

316
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,170
<i>There's no way this
child created Shinonome.
What?</i>

317
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,670
<i>There's no way this
child created Shinonome.</i>

318
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,260
Who's this?
<i>There's no way this
child created Shinonome.</i>

319
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,340
Who's this?

320
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,970
<i>Perhaps she's
Shinonome's relative?
Who's this?</i>

321
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,050
<i>Perhaps she's
Shinonome's relative?</i>

322
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,300
Ms. Nakamura, from school.
<i>Perhaps she's
Shinonome's relative?</i>

323
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,380
Ms. Nakamura, from school.

324
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,140
<i>A younger sister?
Ms. Nakamura, from school.</i>

325
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,470
<i>Does that mean this
child is also a robot?</i>

326
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,720
Hello, I'm the professor. I made Nano.

327
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,230
<i>Shoulder Block!</i>

328
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,930
Professor! Why did you say that?

329
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,270
<i>Made her? This child
made Shinonome?
Professor! Why did you say that?</i>

330
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:03,350
<i>Made her? This child
made Shinonome?</i>

331
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,940
I had to introduce myself...
<i>Made her? This child
made Shinonome?</i>

332
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,110
Hey!

333
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,860
Do something about this!

334
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,190
The kid did something again!

335
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,820
<i>H-ho...</i>

336
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,410
<i>Homunculus!</i>

337
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,120
<i>The surveillance bot,
the strange Dharma,</i>

338
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,790
<i>the child professor, Shinonome Nano, and a homunculus...</i>

339
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,290
<i>Entering unarmed and
unprepared was foolish...</i>

340
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,800
<i>This place is extremely dangerous!</i>

341
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,550
Professor, what kind of knot is this?
<i>I must find an opportunity to
escape and form a new plan,</i>

342
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:31,630
<i>I must find an opportunity to
escape and form a new plan,</i>

343
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,760
It's a tight, tight one.
<i>I must find an opportunity to
escape and form a new plan,</i>

344
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:32,840
<i>I must find an opportunity to

345
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,630
Hey, are you done yet?
<i>I must find an opportunity to

346
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:33,720

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,430
<i>but...
Hey, are you done yet?</i>

348
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,600
<i>I'm worried about being attacked, so I must tread carefully.</i>

349
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,980
<i>If I simply tell
them I'm leaving...</i>

350
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,860
<i>I have no choice.</i>

351
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,990
May I use your restroom?

352
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh, yes. Let me show you...

353
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,110
No!

354
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,740
If you tell me where
it is, I'll find it myself!

355
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,500
<i>You fell for it, Shinonome Nano.</i>

356
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,420
<i>I will escape.</i>

357
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,420
<i>I knew you'd believe what
I said without question.</i>

358
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,430
<i>Kindness is your weakness.</i>

359
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,100
<i>Next time I come, the winds
will blow against you.</i>

360
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,520
<i>Just you wait. As long as
you have that weakness,</i>

361
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>I shall rise again!</i>

362
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,980
Are you leaving?

363
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,190
<i>Oh, no...</i>

364
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Uh, no... it's just, they
asked me to cut the grass...

365
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,370
Hold on!

366
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,540
Wh-what...

367
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
<i>Oh, no! I've been discovered!</i>

368
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,830
<i>They knew I would try to escape...</i>

369
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,960
<i>Damn it! What is this?</i>

370
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,920
<i>My body... I can't move!</i>

371
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,090
This way!

372
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,340
Huh? I thought she had
to use the restroom.

373
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,300
What is this?

374
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,680
Professor, this glue
dissolves in water, right?

375
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,390
<i>If I'm captured now, it's all over.
What?</i>

376
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,480
<i>If I'm captured now, it's all over.</i>

377
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Water! Water!

378
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,150
<i>My hopes! My reason to live!
Water! Water!</i>

379
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,230
<i>My hopes! My reason to live!</i>

380
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,020
What? I can't hear you.

381
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,860
<i>Damn. I must do something...
What? I can't hear you.</i>

382
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,070
<i>Damn you, Shinonome Laboratory!
Take this off first!</i>

383
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,150
<i>Damn you, Shinonome Laboratory!</i>

384
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,990
Nano, snacks.
<i>Damn you, Shinonome Laboratory!</i>

385
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,910
Water! Water!

386
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,030
<i>Someone... someone help me!
Water! Water!</i>

387
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,120
<i>Someone... someone help me!</i>

388
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,370
What should I do?
<i>Someone... someone help me!</i>

389
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,540
<i>Someone... someone help me!</i>

390
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,110
No Impermanence of Living Things
No Killing of Living Things

391
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:53,920
Oh, I have that.

392
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,500
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 109
Oh, I have that.

393
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:55,590
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 109

394
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,710
Really? Could I borrow it?

395
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,920
Sure. I'll bring it next time.

396
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,220
Thanks. I'm excited.

397
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,300
"You never know what's
gonna happen. That's baseball."

398
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,090
Annaka, I didn't know you
were such a maniac.

399
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,180
Is that all?
Annaka, I didn't know you
were such a maniac.

400
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,430
Yeah. Suddenly, she started
laughing, and she cheered up.

401
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Maybe she's just
pretending to be happy.

402
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,310
The one she's always
loved broke her heart...

403
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,940
I guess I can see that.
No, my interests are
still pretty shallow.

404
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,320
No, my interests are
still pretty shallow.

405
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,190
Which?
No, my interests are
still pretty shallow.

406
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,280
Which?

407
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,200
Yukko, did you forget
your homework again?

408
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,660
No!

409
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,280
Oh, but I really did
forget my homework.

410
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,080
Which is it?

411
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,910
The answer...

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,250
after this commercial break!

413
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,040
What?

414
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,290
How funny, Aioi!

415
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,420
Right, Minakami?

416
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,590
Fleming?

417
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,300
Rap?

418
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,470
Naganohara, I wanted to
ask you something else...

419
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,590
S-sure.

420
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,010
What is it?

421
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,760
Doesn't that series
have a few spin-offs?

422
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,640
Aioi, do you have any ideas
for cheering up Naganohara?

423
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,600
If you have any, could
I borrow them, too?

424
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,860
Why did they leave?

425
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,660
I wanted to get something
to eat with them...

426
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,950
What are you doing?

427
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,250
Congratulations!

428
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,500
Have a lottery ticket.

429
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,710
What are you doing?
You're Yukko, aren't you?

430
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,880
Yukko? Who's that?

431
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,460
It's obviously you.

432
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,300
And Nano, I can see your key.

433
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,630
I-it's not robot-like in any way!

434
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,800
In any case, those who pass
here must enter the lottery!

435
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,100
Come on, hurry up! Hurry!

436
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,680
I don't understand you...

437
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,520
Do I just turn this?

438
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,150
Congratulations.

439
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,030
Why are you being so loud?

440
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,070
Here's your prize!

441
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,570
What is it?

442
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,160
Just take it!

443
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,410
What?

444
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,660
I'm always saying that your
ideas aren't very funny...

445
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,130
Once you've received your
prize, be on your way.

446
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,470
Thank you very much.

447
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,760
An extra prize...

448
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,140
I just carved it.

449
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,350
Thanks...

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,880

It's your fault we're lost!

470
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,760
I apologize.

471
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,590
Shall I look up our location
on my mobile phone?

472
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,300
You sound like a foreigner.

473
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,010
Call it a cell phone!

474
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,560
Why are you watching that?

475
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,100
Tachibana Misato,
why not watch it with me?

476
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,730
I'm not into that!

477
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,910
I'm Nano's key.

478
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,160
Sometimes, I spin.
Sometimes, I don't.

479
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,620
Sometimes, I come off.

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,410
