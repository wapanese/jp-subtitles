00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,360
Thanks for waiting.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,400
This is all I can make.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,860
Here.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,280
Amazing. It's twice cooked pork.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,490
I was just feeling really hungry.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,540
I wonder if you'll be able to
identify the secret ingredient.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,580
You must have gone all out,
to use a secret ingredient.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,710
Thanks for the food.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,170
<i>I can't taste
anything but miso...</i>

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,390
<i>Her secret ingredient
isn't secret at all.</i>

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,060
<i>In fact, the more I chew,</i>

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,680
<i>the worse this secret
ingredient tastes.</i>

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,060
<i>I'm against this
secret ingredient!</i>

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,790

Nah, it's one-sided

Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,180
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,110
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

This is the first time it has happened to me,

My love took a sudden turn

And I instantly blushed a deep red

N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,590
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,300
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation

<i>A kappa?</i>

Isn't he cool?

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,150

<i>It's huge!</i>

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,250
<i>And it's a tengu.</i>

73
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,960
<i>She must have read
"parasite" as "parashite."</i>

74
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,670

154
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,400

That was the truth,
from the bottom of her heart.

166

She was neither trying
to protect the principal,

nor too lazy to explain the scenario.

168
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,700

to show respect

had just fought.

referee for 10-yen soccer.

177
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,900
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

178
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,400
You don't get it, do you?

179
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,740
It's all about the mood.

180
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,110
Let's kick off!

181
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,300
I guess I have no choice.

182
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,050
Bring it on!

183
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,800
Okay.

184
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,450
First comes rock,
then comes paper...

185
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,120
You can't throw all of them,

186
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,870
rock, paper, scissors!

187
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:11,910

<i>It won't die in one spray,</i>

198
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,680

199
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,020
<i>Besides...</i>

200
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,270

201
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,560

<i>N-no!</i>

205
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,910
<i>With nowhere to run, it'll fly.</i>

206
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,040
<i>If it takes off, it's over.</i>

207
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,590
<i>It'll charge right at people.</i>

208
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,500
<i>If it touches my body...</i>

209
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,920

<i>No!</i>

211

Mr. Sakamoto! Please help me.

220
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,600
Under this bowl,
there's a ro-roa... a roach...

221
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
A what?

222
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,270
You mean a cockroach?

223
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,900
Fine. I'll take care of it.

224
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,440
Thank you.

225
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,570
Hey.

226
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,610
Yes?

227
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,240
What are you doing?

228
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,280
I'll get it, so lift the bowl.

229
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,540
What?

230
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,870
No... I'm telling
you to lift the bowl.

231
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,710
If you don't, I can't get it.

232
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,250
Hey!

233
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,800
Wha... what are you saying?

234
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,340
You want me to release
this minion of evil?

235
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,300
This is Pandora's box!

236
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,350

it's death or die!

237
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,640
No, no, no.

238
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,390
How am I supposed to get
it if you don't lift the bowl?

239
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,810
Lift it yourself!

240
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,560
How am I supposed to do that?

241
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,280

cockroach inside this bowl.

247
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,050
I-I'd appreciate it if
you'd take care of it.

248
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,420
Sure.

249
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,930
<i>R-r-r-rock and roll!</i>

250
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,760
Thank you. Please do.

251
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,930
Okay.

252
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,560
I'll knock it out with a single blow.

253
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,640
Head strike!

254
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,940
I missed.

257
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,120
I hate you, Professor!

258
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,130
<i>She's crying?</i>

259
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,470
I-I'm just kidding! Gosh...

260
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,970
There's no way I would hate you.

261
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,470
Professor, I love you.

262
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,560
Nano!

263
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,570
Oh, Professor...

264
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,700
Nano!

265
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,410
Now, it's time to rock and roll.

266
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,130
Count To 10

267
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,880
It's hot. Can I get out?

268
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,680
What? You just got in.

269
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,550
But it's hot.

270
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,850
You can get out on 10.

271
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,390
20 log root 10!

272
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,060
What?

273
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
I got to 10. Can I get out now?

274
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Um...

275
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,480
You have to count, 1... 2...

276
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,240
What?

277
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,120
Oh, come on.

286
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,910
Yukko, how's the curry?

287
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,500
It's almost done.

288
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,080
I'm pretty hungry.

289
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,880

290
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,460
Mai, how are things over there?

291
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,050
A big one's coming.

292
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,090
We'll have a feast tonight.

293
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,180
All right. This should be good.

294
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,890
Thanks for waiting.

295
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,400
The crazy delicious
super-curry is done.

296
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,110
These will take a little longer.

297
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,160
We should have started
them before the curry.

298
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,830
Well, they say you
have to be patient.

299
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,540
Oh, we should have
brought mayonnaise.

300
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,840
Don't you think mayonnaise
goes with curry, Yukko?

301
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,800
M-mayo...

302
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,920
What do you think, Yukko?

303
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,140
B-barf!

304
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,140
Just kidding.

305
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,150
No, no. Th-this isn't
what it looks like...

306
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,650
Here, lo-look. We've
still got jelly noddles.

307
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,360
Jelly noo... just kid...

308
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,120
What color...

309
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,450
Mio?

310
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,950
What color...

311
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,960
What color is your blood?

312
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,140
Sorry, Mai!

313
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,680
There's no curry
or rice for lunch!

314
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,320
Mai?

315
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,230
We still have jelly noodles.

316
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Mai!

317
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,290
Release.

318
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,630
Well.

319
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,550
Here, we have a single
package of jelly noodles.

320
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,100
Just one?

321
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,390
I think we should pass
it around and share it.

322
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,690
However, you and I are to blame...

323
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,270
So, Mai, you eat first.

324
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,280
Rock, paper, scissors!

325
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,320
Yes!

326
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,570
Just don't eat it all in one bite!

327
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,200
I wouldn't do that.

328
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,330
I'm not mean.

329
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,950
I'll eat first.

330
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,300
I choked...

331
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,330
I know! Let's play cards!

332
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:54,870
No.

333
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,000
At this rate, we'll remember this as a disappointing camping trip!

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Let's give it a happy ending!

335
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,260
I know!

336
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,350
What's up?

337
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,140
I completely forgot.

338
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,560
At times like this,
adults drink, right?

339
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,770
Yeah.

340
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,940
Don't you agree, Mai?

341
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,570
I actually brought some.

342
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,700
You're not serious, Mio.

343
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,870
I'm dead serious.

344
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,780
A delinquent.
There's a delinquent here.

345
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,910
Ta-dah!

346
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:33,950
Vinegar
Ta-dah!

347
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,120
Vinegar

348
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,130
Let's chug it!

349
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,800
Mio, stop! You'll kill yourself!

350
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,460
We've still got Mai's!

351
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,100
This is cider.

352
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,840
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

353
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,930
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

354
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:38,270
and at times my friends and I chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

355
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:44,060
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence

00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:50,900
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

357
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,910
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

358
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:03,170
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

359
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:13,090
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

360
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:22,060
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

361
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:28,320
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

362
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:38,790
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

363
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,420
Short Thoughts
Short Thoughts

364
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,000
After a bath,

365
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,010
I drink a glass of milk
and pretend to be drunk.

366
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,800
I'm Peso!

367
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,140
I'm 10 yen!

368
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,050
I'm a Wadou Kaichin!

369
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,720
No, no! You can't measure
a person's value in money!

370
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:01,470
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 7.

371
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,270
Narration:  Tachiki Fumihiko

372
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,520
Don't miss it.
