This is the first time it has happened to me,

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,780
maybe I have a fever?

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,580
Suddenly my first love wavered

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,150
Hey, Mio.

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,280
What?

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,700
I've been wondering for a while now...

35
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,240
Why do you always
wear those pigtail holders?

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,410
Oh, these? Well...

37
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,410
I just do, I guess.

38
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,670
You just do?

39
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,630
I just do, so I do.

40
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,170
I forgot my math notebook...

41
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,470
Huh? We have math today?

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,050
We do. We even had
homework, remember?

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,350
I'll go get it. You go on ahead.

44
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,480
<i>Well, I didn't do my homework,</i>

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,850
<i>so it doesn't matter
where my notebook is.</i>

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,900
Mai!

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,650
Selamat pagi!

Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 9

49
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,290
Here it is! Ms. Mai's doing it!

50
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,750
Is this her dreaded silent treatment?

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,590
The scale is huge.

52
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,300
Like a mountain...
it's mountainous!

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,850
Maybe it actually is a mountain?

54
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,390
<i>I guess not...</i>

55
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
I know...

56
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,800
I know why you're mad, Mai.

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,430
I was watching TV in my room last night...

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,190
It's because I took a piece of broccoli from your lunch yesterday, isn't it?

59
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,480
That's why I bought some broccoli!

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,400
I didn't know you liked
broccoli until after I ate it.

61
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I knew I'd done something terrible,

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,360
and so, I'm giving you this.

63
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,490
My dad just wouldn't shut up, so...

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,380
<i>It's not the broccoli.</i>

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,220
<i>It isn't the cauliflower, either.</i>

66
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,190
<i>So much has happened lately,
so I can't tell exactly why she's mad.</i>

67
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,030
<i>But I've got a general idea.</i>

68
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,780
<i>I don't want things to
stay this way forever...</i>

69
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,580
<i>I'll just have to apologize!</i>

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,290
Mai!

71
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,580
I'm sorry I ate your
main dish yesterday!

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,550
I'm sorry I ate your bunnies!

73
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,050
I'm sorry I ate your rice!

74
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,340
I'm sorry I didn't eat
your black beans!

75
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,270
What is it? Why are you so mad?

76
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,560
I don't get it...

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,140
You're not mad about
yesterday's lunch?

78
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,110
Is this about the time you
had that thing on your desk?

79
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,650
Is it because I broke your
Maitreya statue's neck?

80
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,580
Or because I borrowed
it without asking?

81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,420
Or because I secretly buried it?

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,920
Is it because I changed my mind
and left an offering on your desk?

83
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,880
Is it because I changed my
mind again and burned it?!

84
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,600
Hey, Mai!

85
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,610
Oh, you were listening to music?

86
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,030
No wonder you didn't hear me.

87
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,240
I didn't notice, so I've just
been talking to myself.

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,870
<i>That was close.
I almost spilled the beans...</i>

89
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,210
The second half.

90
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
I didn't know about that.

92
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,220
Oh, Tanaka!

93
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,510
Oh, Tanaka!

94
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,850
I'm sorry, but do you have a minute?

95
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,270
Uh, um, d-don't you think that hairstyle's...

96
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,310
just a little... inappropriate?

97
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,520
Teacher.

98
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
Yes?

99
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,690
Want a red bean pancake?

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,290
<i>There are still five minutes until math...</i>

103
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,340
<i>Mio already showed me
her homework yesterday...</i>

104
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,050
<i>Just this once!</i>

105
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,340
<i>I can't ask her again!</i>

106
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,300
<i>I'll have to...</i>

107
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,560
Mai...

108
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,480
This is really embarrassing.

109
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,440
I forgot to do my math homework.

110
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,110
I'd be really glad if, maybe, if you don't mind, you could show me yours for just a minâ€“

111
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,650
Here.

112
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,150
Oh, thanks! Thank you!

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,570
Just wait a second. I'll copy
this at super-mach speed!

114
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,950
Oh, no! I'm really late!

115
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, no! Oh, no!

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,540
Shut up! It's still early, Masao!

117
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,290
Oh, no! I'm really late!

118
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,090
I've been laid off!

119
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,640
That's strange. Um, Mai...

120
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,220
This doesn't look like
the math worksheet...

121
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,900
I'll buy you some juice!

122
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,320
Here.

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,400
Thanks!

124
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm late to school, and my
dad's been laid off! Oh, no!

125
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,370
I don't have time for this!

126
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,830
Look! Masao's in trouble!

127
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,080
What's Masao going to...

128
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,540
No... wait.

129
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,920
I don't have time for this, either!

130
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,040
I almost got distracted!

131
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,550
The worksheet, Mai!

132
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,590
I'll buy you that thing from the station!

133
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,670
Here.

134
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,260
Thanks!

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,430
This! This is it!

136
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,720
You had it, after all.

137
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,770
Why didn't you just
hand it over, you tease?

138
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,270
I'll knock it out in a second.

So, does anyone know the
answer to this problem?

143
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,380
No one?

<i>and he yells at you for
answering problems wrong.</i>

147
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,060
Bear in mind that your lack of enthusiasm will be reflected on your evaluations.

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,400
<i>So that's his game...</i>

151
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,330
Well, how should we do this...

152
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,790
Today is the 23rd,
so student number 23...

153

<i>There it is!</i>

155
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,540
is absent today.

156
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,170
What?

157
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,920
<i>I... I'm cramping up!</i>

158
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,050
<i>Why did my arm
have to cramp up now?</i>

<i>This isn't good. I'll end
up in his field of vision.</i>

Well, it's May, so student number five will...

161
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,430
No, I just called on him.

162
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,690
<i>Must stay out of sight. Out of sight...</i>

163
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,270

<i>The chair! I'll pretend it was the chair...</i>

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,360
What's that sound? What is that?

167
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,860
Hey! Someone's phone is ringing.

168
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,530
Thanks for calling.

169
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,870

171
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,020
Now, about this problem...

Aioi.

173
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,660
First comes rock! Then comes paper...

174
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,370
You can't throw all of them,

175
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,330
rock, paper, scissors!

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's fading!

177
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,490
Um... I bought milk and sugar.

178
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,990
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 12

179
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,570
I didn't forget anything, right?

180
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,490
Eggs were cheap today, weren't they?

181
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:04,780
I didn't forget anything, right?

182
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,160
Eggs were cheap today, weren't they?

183
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,580
I bought two cartons.

184
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:08,830
What a good deal.

185
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,960
Oh, no! Eggs were on sale today...

186
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,040
What should I do?
I can still make it.

187
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,010
I guess I'll go back to the store.

188
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,220
It's a black cat...

189
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,640
H-how cute...

190
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,610
There's no way I can keep it.

191
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,280
I already have the
professor to take care of...

192
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,490
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm home...

194
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,760
Welcome back!

195
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,640
What? That cat!

196
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,140
I found him!

197
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,100
You can't just bring cats home.

198
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,770
What? But he's cute...

199
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,520
That's true...

200
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,900
I mean, no! That's not it!

201
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,070
You don't think he's cute?

202
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,030
No, he's cute. He's cute, but...

203
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,620
If we keep a pet, you'll
have to take care of him.

204
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,040
Can you do that?

205
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,080
I can!

206
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,750
I won't help at all.

207
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,250
You can't forget to
clean up his litterbox.

208
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,670
You won't do anything?

209
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,090
Then I won't let you
touch him, either!

210
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,680
B-but... no! That's not what I...

211
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,690
Professor, he fell asleep!

212
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,150
I want to pet him!

213
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,110
He's so fluffy!

214
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,450
No fair, Professor! Me, too! Me, too!

215
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,990
His stomach is fluffy, too!

216
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,500
His sides are fluffy, too!

217
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,370
His right foot is fluffy, too!

218
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,830
His left foot is fluffy, too!

219
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,670
His tail is even fluffier!

220
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,970
The back of his ears
are fluffier than his tail.

221
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,340
What? But when I touched
it, the tail seemed...

222
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,970
His tail isn't fluffy!

223
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,650
What's wrong?
Are you hurt somewhere?

224
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,610
Eureka!

225
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,610
Hold on.

226
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,450
Professor?

227
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,040
Nano! Nano! Nano!

228
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,130
I invented a scarf that
will allow him to speak!

229
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,550
Amazing, Professor! That was fast!

230
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,630
Let's put it on Sakamoto.

231
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,550
Sakamoto? That cat's
name is Sakamoto?

232
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,930
Yeah! That's what
was written on his box.

233
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,480
Doesn't that seem
a bit too simple?

234
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,770
Finished!

235
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,270
Will he talk?

236
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,980
He will.

237
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,530
I want to hear it...

238
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,500
That was too much
petting, don't you think?

239
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,750
When cats meow, they're
almost always hungry.

240
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,760
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

241
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,340
Also, my name!

242
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,680
Calling me Sakamoto just because the box said so is too simple.

243
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,180
I'm sorry...

244
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,770
Didn't I tell you?

245
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,770
But...

246
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,690
How old are you?

247
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,900
Eight years old.

248
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
One year old.

249
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,030
In human years, I'm twenty years old.

250
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,660
It's <i>Mr.</i> Sakamoto to you.

251
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,030
Osaka dialect...

252
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,910
I'm grateful that I'll be getting
my food for free from now on...

253
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,080
but don't forget to
respect your elders.

254
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,630
And while I have your attention,

255
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,340
you both should reflect on
how much you should pet a cat.

256
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,880
To be honest, I don't
dislike being petted,

257
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,260
but even cats have their limits...

258
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm going to return him to
where we found him, okay?

259
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,470
Yeah.

260
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,310
W-wait, wait!

261
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,320
Straw

263
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,720
Here you are.

264
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,470
Are you sure?

265
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,100
I haven't paid my rent yet,
and now you're giving me food...

266
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,310
It's fine. Good neighbors
should help each other in need.

267
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,980
Let me know if there's
anything else you need.

268
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,150
Really? In that case...

269
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,490
I don't suppose I could
borrow some money?

270
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,990
Don't get cocky over a few favors.

271
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,990
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,660
Straw Part 2

273
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,460
V-Vice principal, is this...

274
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,090
What's all the confusion about, Principal?

275
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,340
Try opening its body...

276
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,900
If I win,

277
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:09,940
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 13

278
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,980
I don't have to buy
that thing from the station.

279
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,730
Okay?

280
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,610
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 13

281
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,240
Okay.

282
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,360
<i>I've got this!</i>

283
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,950
Battle for juice, ready...

284
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,870
Go!

285
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,210
Mai, that was a false start.

286
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,000
Right, Mio?

287
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,170
I guess it was a little early. Just a bit.

288
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,510
Right? Let's start over!

289
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,090
Let's start fresh. Ready...

290
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,220
Go!

291
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,810
Mai wins!

292
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,230
I underestimated my
opponent's strength.

293
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,480
I'm finally warmed up.

294
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,650
One more time!

295
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,120
Oh, my. My arm is pretty sore...

296
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,410
I was up all night!

297
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,080
My body and mind are heating up.

298
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,750
Are you ready for the real battle?

299
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,260
Oh, shoot! I looked away...

300
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,550
I let her win three times in a row.

301
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,010
What a surprise!

302
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,430
Yukko, why don't you...

303
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,020
Wait.

304
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,310
Just wait... I see, I see.
I understand now. I get it.

305
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,530
Your beginner's luck
runs out here, Mai!

306
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,030
Let's have a fair fight!

307
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,570
Ready...

308
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,440
<i>Chest!</i>

309
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,120
Pretty fun, isn't it?

310
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,370
What is this?

311
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,250
Yukko...

312
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,210
So, this is what they
call arm wrestling?

313
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,340
Mio, take this!

314
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,300
Could you hold on
to that for a while?

315
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,800
It's finally time to
break out the big guns.

316
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,180
Oh, come on!

317
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,690
I can't give it my
best if you don't!

318
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,190
All right? This time,
give it your best shot!

319
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,940
I'll give it my all, too!

320
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
<i>Earth Dangerous!</i>

321
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,020
<i>Shooting Shake!</i>

322
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,440
<i>Death!</i>

323
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
<i>Dea...</i>

324
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,140
What was that...

325
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,430
I just don't understand.

326
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:54,020
Why did I get so worked up over a simple arm wrestling match?

327
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,610
I forgot I had to use the bathroom.

328
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,570
I'll be right back.

329
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,780
I knew something was wrong...

330
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,570
Yukko.

331
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,910
That thing from the
station. And 23 juices.

332
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:29,890
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

333
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,940
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

334
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,320
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

335
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,070
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

336
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,960
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

337
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

338
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,220
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

339
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:17,140
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

340
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,110
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

341
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,370
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

342
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:42,420
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

343
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,090
My arm cramped up, and I got
yelled at for not doing my homework.

344
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,050
Today sucks...

345
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,430
But!

346
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,390
Mai! What's going
to happen to Masao?

347
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,730
Hey, Mai!

348
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,110
Fine. I'll buy you another juice.

349
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,860
Okay.

350
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,690
All right!
