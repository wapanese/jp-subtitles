00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,490
Wh-what are you
doing here this early?

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,240
I'm on duty today.

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,120
Oh, why don't you help me
take out the garbage?

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,460
Teacher, please don't tell anyone...

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,290
We'll see...

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,040
You're killing me!

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,010
That was close...

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,800
The best friendship, everything is perfect!

Mio.

59
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,900
I made some jam yesterday.

60
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,150
Want to try some?

61
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,610
What's gotten into you?

62
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,030
Well, the other day, I finished
off your marmalade.

63
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,990
Oh! Oh, that...

64
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,200
You must be getting a bit more feminine if you're making jam.

65
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,580
Don't make fun of me!

66
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,880
Try guessing what
kind of jam I made.

67
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,380
Okay, okay.

68
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,340
Let's try a little.

<i>It's so gross, I don't
know what I'm tasting!</i>

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,760
Here, Mio!
Have some Russian tea!

73

<i>Hot! Hot! It's hot, it's hot,</i>

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940

Here, Mio! Cool your
tongue with some jam!

<i>Milk, milk, milk!</i>

87
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,940
Mio, I put the
leftover jam in there.

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,520
<i>What flavor could possibly cause such unmatched revulsion?</i>

89
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,700
<i>It's so gross! Gross, gross, gross, gross...</i>

Okay? Am I okay?

96
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,660
Of course I'm not okay!

97
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,500
Your jam was so disgusting,
my life flashed before my eyes!

98
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,000
I thought it tasted bad, but I didn't think it would be that strong.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,670
Why would you make something you knew would be disgusting?!

100
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,550
I thought it might be fun.

101
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,010
You idiot...

102
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,420
Well, whatever.

103
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,180
So, what flavor do
you think it is?

104
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,850
Who cares?

105
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,470
I bet you put shit-covered
fish or something in it!

106
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,930
Close!

107
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,730
The secret ingredient is...

108
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,780
<i>salt-cured</i> fish!

109
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,530
It stinks!

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,030

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,130
This place is a mess...

116
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,420
Honestly...

117
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,510
he never cleans, no matter
how many times I ask.

118
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,510

You startled me...

Hey!

I told you not to barge in!

Uh, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,330
And why are you
cleaning my room?

134
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,410
Because you never
clean it yourself!

136
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580

138
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,890
Why do you keep coming in?

139
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:38,640

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,850
What <i>is</i> that? What

150
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,890
That totally isn't mine.

151
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,680
I found it in your room!

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,350
What? I've never seen
that before in my life!

153
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,520
Besides, since when
was this <i>my</i> room?

154
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,690
It might not even be my room!

155
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,280
Either way, I think you're
too young for these!

156
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,740
You shouldn't have this!

157
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,450
What? I have no idea
what you're talking about!

158
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,700
I don't understand a
thing you're saying!

159
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,490
Then I'll throw this away!

160
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,390
That belongs to my club president!

161
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,980
What?

162
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,980
You aren't seriously thinking about
throwing away someone else's stuff, right?

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,770
I'm sorry!

164
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:16,110
I just peeked inside,
and it's sort of amazing...

165
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,870
But you shouldn't be
looking at these yet.

166
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,580
You'll become a delinquent...

167
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,450
Got it! I won't look at them!

168
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,870
I won't look at them,
so stay out of my room!

169
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,250
This sucks...

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,130

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,880
Can't you at least knock?

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,720
But I thought you might be mad...

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,810
I'm not mad!

175
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,020
See? You <i>are</i> mad.

176
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,270
I'm not mad!
I'm not mad, so get out!

177
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,940
If you don't knock
next time, I'll... you know!

178
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,310
I totally will!

179
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,940
I want to live alone...

180
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,700
<i>I messed up today...</i>

181
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,700
<i>He says his room is clean, even
though it looks like a typhoon hit it.</i>

182
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,160
<i>And that book
wasn't Mako's, either.</i>

183
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,710
<i>But the morals at school
have gotten pretty lax.</i>

184
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,840
<i>I have to keep it together,
at school and at home.</i>

185
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,500
<i>I'm the student adviser!</i>

186
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,130
I completely forgot...

187
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,300
Mako, I'm ordering some takeout.

188
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,140
How many times do
I have to tell you?!

189
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,640
1 capsule
40 grams

190
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,480
Um, about this
"Hopes for the Future" section...

191
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,360
do you have any
dreams or goals?

192
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,410
Oh, yes.

193
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,410
Um...

194
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,170
Oh! I'd like to be on
TV once, before I die!

195
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,300
Um, that's not what I mean.

196
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm sorry. I guess I didn't
ask the right question.

197
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,050
Is there a job or career
you'd like to pursue?

198
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:12,060
Oh, um, let's see... yes, um...

199
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,570
I'd like to be a teacher
like you, Ms. Sakurai!

200
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,700
Like... me?

201
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh, um... uh... well...

202
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,920
<i>This is our sash!</i>

203
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,800
<i>It's up to you, Nakamura!</i>

204
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,430
<i>This is our last college run!</i>

205
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,270
He's dropping out!

206
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,980
Tokisadame University
has withdrawn.

207
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,160
Hey, Nano.

208
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,240
Yes, what is it?

209
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,290
On our way to your house,
we ran into the professor.

210
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,750
But some dogs attacked us.

211
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,170
Sounds like you had some trouble.

212
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,460
Tell the professor we'll
come by another time.

213
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,260
Okay.

214
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,010
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 99

215
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,310
Teacher! Please be our adviser!

216
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,980
No way! Never!

217
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,730
What the heck? You said
you'd do it just the other day!

218
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,480
When did I say that?

219
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,110
I can't believe it...

220
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,240
You promised you'd be our
adviser if I could defeat you.

221
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,570
<i>That one time?</i>

222
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,200
No! We called that match
a draw due to injury!

223
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,290
What?

224
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,920
Well, I guess I'll tell everyone
about your feelings for my sister.

225
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,710
Where's your club room?

226
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,970
This way!

227
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,010
Yes! Today, the Go-Soccer
club will finally get started!

228
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,050
Yeah!

229
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,140
President!

230
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,980
S-sorry for barging in!

231
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,570
Uh, I brought our new adviserâ€”

232
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,530
H-hold on!

233
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,150
Why are you running?

234
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,200
Mr. Takasaki!

235
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,620
Looks like he's gone.

236
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,240
I was just about to go
recruit members, too.

237
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,540
I can't really explain
this club without Sakurai...

238
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,590
Whatever. It's my club.

239
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:49,600
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 100

240
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,310
I'm so nervous...

241
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,560
Why are <i>you</i> nervous?

242
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,400
Because you're on your way to confess
your feelings to this Nakanojo guy, right?

243
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,860
Yeah. He's the punk spirit
of this peaceful school!

244
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,570
That mohawk is just irresistible.

245
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,860
Maybe not irresistible,
but it's certainly unique.

246
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,490
Teacher!

247
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,290
Wait!

248
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,560
Hey, Mr. Takasaki... why did you run?

249
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,180
I haven't played such a passionate Go-Soccer game in a long time.

250
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,650
I can't imagine anyone
else as our adviser!

251
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,690
I'm sorry, but I've got...
you know, things...

252
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,490
I have things... and stuff... well, so...

253
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,370
You came with me all
the way to the room.

254
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,620
I have no choice.

255
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,540
Teacher...

256
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,840
After seeing this,
can you still refuse?

257
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,930
You... this is...!

258
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,770
That's right.

259
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,480
It's a photograph of my
sister in high school.

260
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,980
Well, teacher?
What will you do?

261
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,360
In exchange for this photo,
will you be our adviser?

262
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,070
<i>I-I want it!</i>

263
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,370
<i>I want it so much...</i>

264
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,910
<i>But I feel like if I agree,
I'll lose something important.</i>

265
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,750
Sakurai...

266
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,330
Yes?

267
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,590
Sorry, but...

268
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,220
it sounds like a good deal to me!

269
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,470
<i>What am I doing?!</i>

270
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,600
Great! Then you'll
become our adviser?

271
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,270
<i>I'm terrible...</i>

272
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,320
<i>Such inappropriate
behavior for a teacher.</i>

273
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,030
<i>However, while I may be
a teacher, I'm also a man.</i>

274
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,110
<i>Necessity knows no law!</i>

275
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Listen, Sakurai!

276
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,740
If I'm doing this, we're aiming
for the national championship!

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,370
Got it?

278
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:21,830
Yes!

279
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,130
Great! The Go-Soccer
club begins today!

280
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,670
We'll get started first
thing tomorrow!

281
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,590
Yes!

282
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,300
This is it.

283
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,680
Oh, really?

284
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,850
Hey.

285
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,470
Yes?

286
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,020
Is Nakanojo here?

287
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,650
Oh, yes.

288
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,480
Nakanojo!

289
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,520
Nakanojo, someone's
here to see you.

290
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,160
Yes. Can I help you?

291
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,410
<i>So unappealing...</i>

292
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,560
Love-like

293
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,560
Dad, would you
go look for me?

294
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,690
Okay.

295
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,530
Well?

296
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,260
<i>Which is it?</i>

297
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,650
Wet Paint

298
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,740
The train will make
a brief stop here.

299
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,750
Someone
Help Me

300
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,340
Minakami, what are
you doing here?

301
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,590
I came to play.

302
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,640
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 101

303
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,140
Thank you for
all these snacks.

304
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,730
She's the one who
let her dogs bite me!

305
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,020
What?

306
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,900
It's definitely her.

307
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,700
I'll go make some tea.

308
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,420
What are you doing here?

309
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,050
Here.

310
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,720
What is that?

311
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,180
Yamantaka.

312
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,260
I don't want it.

313
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,430
But it's cool.

314
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,180
It's not cool at all.

315
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,190
This is interesting.

316
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,310
What is it?

317
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,070
A 36-mat apartment with
living, dining, and kitchen.

318
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,070
That's not interesting at all.

319
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,400
No bath, no toilet, no windows.

320
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,860
Not interesting.

321
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,830
What are you drawing?

322
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,040
I'm not telling you.

323
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,140
Here.

324
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,760
A blue shark.

325
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,020
It's so cool!

326
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,230
You can have it.

327
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,940
Yay!

328
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,940
Hey, draw another shark!

329
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,530
Okay.

330
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,450
Draw a smiling shark!

331
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,110
Okay.

332
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,450
Will you trade with me?

333
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,950
Okay.

334
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,370
Thanks for waiting...

335
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,500
Huh?

A
I'm going home.
Minakami

337
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,380
Professor, did Minakami leave?

338
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,090
Yeah, but I told her to
come back and draw more.

339
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,550
I see.

340
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,350
I wonder why she came over.

Why, I wonder, did I grow sad
naze kashira kanashiku natte

352
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,440
when once I looked up at the sky alone
hitori de miageta sora

353
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,780
This deeply blue sky
tottemo aoi sora

354
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,750
The sky let us listen
sora wa kikasete kureta

355
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,710
to the song of clouds undefeated by the wind
kaze ni mo makenai kumo no uta

356
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:48,590
so that we would no longer weep when alone
hitori demo mou nakanai you ni

357
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,940
Short Thoughts

358
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,290
It <i>is</i> a big deal.

359
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,510
I'm a graduation photo.

360
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,510
When someone sees a photo
and says you were cute,

361
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,680
doesn't it make you think,
"So I'm not cute now?"

362
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,510
The next episode of
<i>Nichijou</i> is episode 24.

363
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,180
Narration:     Horie Yui

364
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,480
Don't miss it.
