1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,350
All right! Let's go!

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,150
Rock, paper, scissors!

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,810
Glico

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,260
Looks like I'm first.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,150
Glico

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,820
Pi-ne-ap-p-le!

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,280
Rock, paper, scissors!

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,410
Okay! Here I come!

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,540
Not like that!

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,080
The rules are that you
go one step at a time!

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,580
I know!

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,170
G-li-co...

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,970
...'s bo-nus prize.

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,260
Hey!

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,180
Huh? What's wrong?

16
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,100
You can't just add words!

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,270
Huh? Aren't you supposed to add words?

18
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,520
What do you think, Mai?

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,640
Fifty-fifty.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,400
All right. That's fine.

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,780
But if you're going to play by your rules,

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,200
I'll play by mine as well.

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,160
Rock, paper, scissors!

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,620
Hey! Next up is Mai!

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,920

Ra-to-na-ri-ha-shi-te-to.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,640
The Spell of Restoration.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,750
Tatta ima hajimete kizuita
I only just noticed

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,380
that I fell in love
Koi ni ochita no dano

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,000
You are on my mind all day, day, day
Nijuuyo jikan kimi kimi kimi

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,840
and I can't do anything about it
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,260
Somehow
Nanka

36
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,050
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,840
with you
Futari

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,680
you seem different from usual, could it be...
Gikochinai kaiwa masaka

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,640
Mutual love?
Ryouomoi

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,890
Nah, it's is one-sided
Iya kataomoi

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,480
Oops, our glances met
Yabai shisen acchatta

42
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,100
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani kono dokidoki

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,030
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo guchagucha konsen

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,070
This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,700
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kana

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,540
Suddenly my first love wavered
Kyuuten shogedashichatta koigokoro

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,130
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Atchuuma kao hakka de makka ka

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,880
My s-s-stupid hands are trembling
Ba-ba-baka na te ga furueru zo

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,510
Is this what's commonly referred to as love?
Kore ga zoku ni iu koi na no

50
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,220
The conversation we h-h-had goes in circles
Ya-ya yacchatta kaiwa kami makuri

51
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,800
Awkward silence, mmhmmhmhm

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,720
I want

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,390
to know your feelings

O-o-o-o-one-sided love

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,390
My first love

on my normal way to school

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,690
I will fall in love

59
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,360
I feel like I can fly in the sky
Sore mo tobesou sa

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,570
O-o-o-o-one-sided love
Ka-ka-ka-ka-kataomoi

61
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,830
It's stopped.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,590
Mom, I told you to
wake me up at seven!

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,000
Mom!

64
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,680
Kick... Kick Volleyball...

Nichijou: Everyday Life

66
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,480
Shoot!

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,230
I'm the class officer today!

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,690
<i>Why did my alarm clock's
batteries have to die today?</i>

69
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,320
<i>If it's running low on batteries,
why can't it just tell me in advance?</i>

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,950
<i>That piece of junk!</i>

71
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,250
<i>Either way, I'll run as fast as
I can. If I hurry, then maybe...</i>

72
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,050
<i>Back there, just then, there was...</i>

73
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,890
<i>something weird!</i>

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,140
<i>And I get the feeling that...</i>

75
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,480
it's coming!

76
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,940
<i>What the heck?</i>

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,440
<i>This sprinter...</i>

78
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,360
<i>Why... is it... following me...</i>

79
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,370
It passed me!

80
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,730
Excuse me.

81
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,190
Did you drop this wooden fish?

82
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,870
Was it a golden fish?

83
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,370
<i>I'm done for.</i>

84
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,580
<i>If I don't do this, I'm done for...</i>

85
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,790
I'm sorry!

86
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,260
Sometimes, I'm a bear.

87
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
And other times, I'm...

88
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,390
a... bear...

89
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,770
But my true identity is...

90
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,660
S-Sorry, sorry!

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,830
Ta-dah! That's right, it's your sister!

92
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,460
I was wearing your school's
uniform, so you didn't notice.

93
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,840
That was f-

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,970
What a spectacular corkscrew
we're seeing this morning.

95
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,270
It's quite amazing!

96
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,480
It was dark at night,

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,900
so I had a tough time
stopping your alarm clock.

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,690
That was you?!

99
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,820
Hey now, don't be like that.

100
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,440
Here, I'll treat you to ramen.

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,740
That's my money!

102
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,240
Chi-yo-ta...

103
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,200

Please enter the Spell of Restoration.

108
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,590
Incorrect spell.

109
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,850
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 6

110
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,440
A shark.

111
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,190
Shark...

112
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,940
I'm home.

113
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,610
Huh? What are you doing, Professor?

114
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,070
Nano, that cloud looks like a shark.

115
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,240
Which one?

116
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,410
Oh, it really does.

117
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,500
Isn't it cool?

118
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,460
It is.

119
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,590
Oh, that's right.

120
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,590
Professor, I bought some milk.

121
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,270
Hey, 4.5%? 4.5%?

122
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,530
Yes, it's extra rich.

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,490
But why the sudden craving for milk?

124
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,700
Well, you see...

125
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,330
I got a roll cake!

126
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,010
What kind of modifications
have you been making to me?

127
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,760
Just roll cake.

128
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,470
I don't understand.

129
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,390
Nano, 4.5% milk!

130
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,520
I don't mean the milk!

131
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,230
Why do I have to live
with a roll cake in my arm?

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,190
It's so cold and tasty...

133
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,610
That's not the issue!

134
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,950
If someone outside
saw this, I'd...

135
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,720
Professor...

136
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
What?

137
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,720
Um... could I have some, too?

138
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,060
Sure.

139
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,180
Just a minute.

140
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,810
Here you go!

141
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,440
Thank you very much.

142
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,040
Um, could I also have
some roll cake, too?

143
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,290
Oh, yeah! Nano, you
can have a sweet bun.

144
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,470
Here you go.

145
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,550
It went back in!

146
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,100
Oh, sorry. I pushed
the button on accident.

147
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,680
Why did you make this?

148
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,890
If this popped out in public,

149
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,150
what do you think would happen?

150
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,650
What would happen?

151
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,730
Without a doubt...

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,150
Wasn't Commando
Sambomaster the best?

153
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,030
It was the be...
Yeah, right?

154
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,120
I'll give you a music
playback function, too.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,790
That's not what I want!

156
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,210
Why do you want to modify me so much?

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,840
Please listen to me...

158
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm full!

159
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,830
What is it?

160
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,460
Sweet bun...

161
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,380
No. You already ate your roll cake.

162
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,770
What? Professor?

163
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,610
Fine! I still have a log cake!

164
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,530
You don't mean... Where
is it this time? Top? Bottom?

165
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,000
P-please, just put them all in
the refrigerator to begin with!

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,670
No!

167
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,340
What?

168
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,090
Shinonome Laboratory

169
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,920
What?

170
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,270
First comes rock!
Then comes paper...

171
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,020
You can't throw all of them,

172
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,810
rock, paper, scissors!

173
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,710
I'm so tired...

174
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,920
Mio!

175
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,670
Why are you smiling like that?

176
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,090
Let me see your notebook!

177
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,930
Did you forget your homework again?

178
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,930
It's kinda embarrassing...

179
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,400
You'll have a tough
time on your exams again.

180
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,900
I know! But just this once!

181
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,110
Please, it'll be the last time! Okay?

182
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,820
Yukko, you said the
same thing last time.

183
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,740
A warrior never goes
back on her word!

184
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,780
You just did.

185
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,370
Wh-What? Oh, really?

186
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh well...

187
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,380
Just this once, all right?

188
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm serious.

189
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,420
I know.

190
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,510
Everyone should have
their own personal Mio.

191
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,090
Yukko, I got that
thing I told you about.

192
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,680
I'll give these back as soon
as I've copied them, okay?

193
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,810
Really? Show me, show me!

194
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,190
<i>Huh? Did I forget something?</i>

195
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,520
<i>Last night, I finished
my homework, and...</i>

196
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,900
<i>I finished my homework, and...</i>

197
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,110
<i>I happened to doodle...</i>

198
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,830
<i>I happened to doodle something!</i>

199
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:31,950
<i>And I forgot to erase it!</i>

200
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,370
I won't let you do that.
<i>And I forgot to erase it!</i>

201
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,750
I forgot!

202
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,540
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 7

203
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,470
I know, right?

204
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,840
Totally.

205
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,930
Yukko!

206
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,220
Sorry, sorry! I forgot
my homework, too!

207
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,930
I can't believe it!

208
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,270
So, I'll be taking that back now.

209
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,190
Sorry!

210
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,360
What? There's nothing to see...

211
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,490
Oh, cut it out. I told
you, I'll do it next time.

212
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,080
Later. Thanks for waiting!

213
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,500
<i>Oh, no...</i>

214
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,080
<i>This isn't good...</i>

215
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,250
<i>If she sees that drawing, she'll definitely think I'm a weirdo.</i>

216
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,800
<i>If it's Yukko who sees that drawing,</i>

217
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,090
<i>the news will spread...</i>

218
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,640
<i>at the speed of sound!</i>

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,770
Yukko!

220
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,690
Th-that's my Japanese notebook.

221
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,320
This is the one for math.

222
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,280
What? But it says "Math" right here...

223
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,950
Y-y-y...

224
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,740
you're wrong!

225
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,200
I-it hurts!

226
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,080
My stomach hurts!

227
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,340
Oh, okay...

228
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,420
I'll have them copied soon,
so just hang on a second.

229
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,170
<i>It's over.</i>

230
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,850
<i>If she sees it here, it's over.</i>

231
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,350
<i>My high school life will be over.</i>

232
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,150
Yukko, I'll buy that
notebook for 1,000 yen!

233
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,570
Why are you running away?

234
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,070
Yukko!

235
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,080
It's not like that! That
notebook... That notebook...

236
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,080
It'll explode!

237
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,130
<i>It's no use.</i>

238
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,800
<i>There's no way for me to
catch up to Yukko on foot.</i>

239
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,220
<i>My life is over...</i>

240
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,720
<i>Thank you, life.</i>

241
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,810
<i>It's been fun up until now.</i>

242
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:07,320
<i>Not everything was perfect,
but it was a happy life.</i>

243
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,070
<i>But this is the end! My life is over!</i>

244
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,370
<i>My banquet of men... is gone...</i>

245
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,290
I! Can't! Let! That! Happen!

246
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,800
My life is on fire!

247
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,520
<i>I still can't reach her...</i>

248
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,860
Yukko! Don't run...

249
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,950
...in the hallway!

250
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,330
Are... Are you okay?

251
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,180
Here.

252
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,100
Pass your notebooks to  the front.

253
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,890
Anyone who forgot their
homework should tell me now.

254
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,440
<i>I was worried for a minute there,</i>

255
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,900
<i>but I'm relieved that nothing happened.</i>

256
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,990
<i>Now I can return to my everyday life...</i>

257
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,910
<i>I didn't erase it.</i>

258
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,370
What's wrong, Naganohara?

259
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,580
Teacher, I forgot my homework!

260
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,130
There we go.

261
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,340
Cleaning

262
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,550
Professor, could you please clean up the mess in this room a bit?

263
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,610
It might be a little early for that.

264
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm going out to play.

265
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,780
Um...

266
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,790
Student
Adviser

267
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,630
Excuse me, Annaka.

268
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,340
Do you have a minute?

269
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,800
Yes?

270
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:23,180
Uh, it's  a bit large, isn't it?
Your ribbon, I mean. I think...

271
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,430
Bzzt. Just kidding!

272
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,480
Cake

273
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,150
This cake is delicious.

274
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,690
It is, isn't it?

275
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,320
Spring Horsetail Lunch Boxes
Tikomato

276
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,780
Welcome.

Nichijou: Everyday Life
Part 8

280
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,440
Sasahara, you do realize that you're
a festival committee member, right?

281
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,650
How about being a little
more serious about this?

282
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,900
I am being quite serious.

283
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,530
As president of the drama club, I'm always doing my part.

284
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,450
Can't you understand
that, Tachibana Misato?

285
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,030
No, I can't!

286
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,330
This is sweet...

287
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,250
Listen!

288
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,460
We're here to decide on what we're doing for the Cultural Festival!

289
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,540
Your drama club is another issue!

290
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,340
We changed brands.

291
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,640
How did I end up in a group with this guy?

292
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,140
Delicious.

293
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,730
My kendo competition is coming up.

294
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,190
I shouldn't have volunteered for the festival committee...

295
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,580
Hey, you! Why are you reading comics?

296
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,380
Until we turn something
in, we can't go home!

297
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,880
Sorry, it's a new volume.

298
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,340
Don't you have any ideas?

299
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,720
Was my wine-tasting
suggestion not a good idea?

300
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,510
It's definitely not good! No way, no how!

301
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,810
Absolutely not!

302
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,280
Hey, Sasahara?

303
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,740
What are you doing?

304
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,080
Sorry, I was out of ideas.

305
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,220
Sasahara, what do you think you're doing?

306
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,470
I must use the restroom.

307
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,230
I don't believe it...

308
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,560
<i>She seems to be in a bad mood today.</i>

309
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,820
<i>I didn't think that my
wine-tasting idea was bad.</i>

310
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,200
<i>And she hasn't come up with a single idea.</i>

311
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,450
<i>But if I mention that, it'll cost me my life.</i>

312
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,250
<i>Which means that I can't
go home until I get an idea.</i>

313
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,050
<i>But, can I lower myself to
think on a commoner's level?</i>

314
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,100
<i>I suppose I'll give it
some serious thought...</i>

315
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,950
Y-you're nothing
special to me. Got it?!

316
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:31,010
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

317
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:37,060
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

318
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,440
and at times my friends and I chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

319
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,190
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

320
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,080
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

321
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

322
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,340
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

323
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:18,260
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

324
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:27,230
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

325
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:33,490
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

326
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:43,540
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

327
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,930
The naivete of Asia.

328
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,260
I'm a sweet bun,

329
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,180
and I'm unpopular in Kansai.

330
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,770
Many people don't know whether

331
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,390
to pronounce my name
as "amashoku" or "kanshoku".

332
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,440
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 3.

333
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,690
Narration: Ikeda Masako

334
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,820
Don't miss it.
