00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,150
Green light... Red light.

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,860
Red Light,
Green Light

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,720
Tattaima hajimete kizuita
I only just noticed

4
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,350
that I fell in love
Koi ni ochita no da naa

5
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,980
You are on my mind all day, day, day
24h kimiOkimiOkimiO

6
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,810
and I can't do anything about it
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen!

7
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,230
Somehow
Nanka

8
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,030
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

9
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,820
with you
Futari

10
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,650
you seem different from usual, could it be...
Gikochinai kaiwa masaka

11
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,610
Mutual love?
Ryouomoi

12
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,860
Nah, it's one-sided
Iya kataomoi

13
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,450
Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,080
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

15
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,000
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

16
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,050
This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

17
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,720
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kanaa

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,470
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

19
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,100
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,850
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

21
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,480
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,190
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation
Yayayacchatta kaiwa kami makuri

23
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,780
Awkward silence, mmhmmhmhm
Kimazui chinmoku mamimumemo

24
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,700
I want
Kimi no

25
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,370
to know your feelings
Kimochi shiritai yo

26
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,280
O-o-one-one-sided love

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,370
My first love

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,200
on my normal way to school
Itsumo no tsuugakuro

glitters brightly
Pikapika hikaru

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,620
I DO fall in love!
I DO fall in love!

31
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,290
I feel like I can fly in the sky
Sora mo tobesou sa

<i>Shoot! Shoot, shoot!
Homeroom is about to start!</i>

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,230
<i>I used "I was helping my
grandmother" the other day.</i>

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,440
<i>"My mother wasn't home"
isn't much of an excuse.</i>

36
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,270
<i>What should I do? How
can I get out of this?</i>

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,070
<i>Couldn't </i>one<i> car drive by?</i>

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,660
<i>How did I get stopped
by four red lights?</i>

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,580
<i>It'll be first period

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,760
<i>There's no way I'd
fall for a classic trap like...</i>

44
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,180
<i>Double!</i>

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,930
<i>What? Why am I being
punished for being late?</i>

46
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,220
<i>What did I do
to deserve this?</i>

47
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,350
<i>Besides being late...</i>

48
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,270
<i>Well, I can just sneak
in through the back.</i>

49
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,690
<i>There's no reason I
have to get yelled at.</i>

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,240
<i>I knew it! It's locked!</i>

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,120
<i>I know! Why don't I sneak
in through the lower door?</i>

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>I'll enter silently,
like the wind,</i>

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>and smoothly join the class...</i>

54
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,750
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

55
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,050
<i>I had a feeling
this would happen!</i>

56
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,630
<i>She's the only one who'd
do something like this!</i>

57
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,010
<i>If I quietly try to
enter from below,</i>

58
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,680
<i>I'll get in even more
trouble if I'm caught.</i>

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,020
<i>If I'm going to be discovered,</i>

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,600
<i>I might as well enter from above!</i>

61
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,830
<i>They put stained glass in!</i>

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,250
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

63
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,090
<i>Why am I running?</i>

64
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,510
<i>Running from the classroom
won't solve anything.</i>

65
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,550
<i>I have to go back...</i>

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,930
<i>That's right.</i>

67
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,260
<i>I need to figure out
the best entrance to use.</i>

68
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,680
<i>If I'm getting in trouble
no matter what I do,</i>

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
<i>I may as well make a grand frontal
assault, and fight to my last breath.</i>

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
<i>Wouldn't that be cool?</i>

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,570
<i>My best option...</i>

72
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,070
<i>is the chalkboard
eraser in the front!</i>

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,570
<i>I'll take an eraser to the face
while grinning ear to ear.</i>

74
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,330
Good morning!

75
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,910
<i>And the entire class
will burst into laughter.</i>

76
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,830
What time do you think it is?

77
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,540
You're hopeless...

78
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,880
Hurry and take your seat.

79
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,960
<i>It'll work!</i>

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,380
<i>That's right, Yukko.</i>

81
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,590
<i>You must be a bright
and cheerful clown!</i>

82
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,140
<i>Let's go!</i>

83
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,810
And a very good morning to you!

84
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,890
Just kidding!

I'm an invincible alien!

89
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,820
Why are you acting stupid?

90
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,030
You're not a grade schooler.

91
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Invincible aliens are immune

92
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,870

Miles would turn in his grave!

96
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,940
Oh, sorry. We just got so into it.

97
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,440
You were listening, Sakamoto?

98
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,900
Was I listening?

99
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
What kind of torture is this?

100
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,570
It's ruining my ears!

101
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,950
I'm gonna play again. So listen, okay?

102
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,280
You listen to me!

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,730
Flowing noodles

104
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,360
<i>I heard they were having
flowing noodles in the park,</i>

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,690
<i>so I decided to check it out.</i>

106
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,070
<i>I've only seen flowing
noodles on TV before,</i>

107
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,160
<i>so I'm really excited.</i>

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,500
<i>Do I have to stand near
the front to get any noodles?</i>

109
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,080
<i>I haven't eaten today,</i>

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,500
<i>so I'll stand near the
front and eat my fill!</i>

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,730
What are you doing?

115
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,190
I've never seen such a lousy customer!

116
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,490
Next round, coming up.

117
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,160
Uh, e-excuse me, um...

118
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,450
What do you want?

119
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,410
Are you quitting before
you've had a bite?

120
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,580
Even if the law may
forgive you, I shall not!

121
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,300
Well, um... I don't
have any chopsticks.

122
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,880
Who do you think you are, kid?

123
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Come on, let's go!

124
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Um, sure.

125
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,520
I-I'm sorry, but these
have been used...

126
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,560
We're recycling.

127
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,060
Next round!

<i>I have no choice.</i>

130
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,400
<i>I'll use the back ends.</i>

131
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,630
It's transient humor.

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,090
The next one will be different!

133
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,760
I'll show you true hell!

134
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,770
Don't expect us to
have infinite water!

135
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,230
So you'd better eat it all.

136
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,450
Excuse me...

137
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,410
Don't be such a wallflower!

138
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,620
Why not try to savor the flavor?

139
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,750
Stop dawdling!

140
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,750
It won't stay fresh forever!

141
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,720

Masaharu!

145
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,660
The moment I heard there were
flowing noodles in the park,

146
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,160
I knew it was you.

147
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,620
I've been doing this...

148
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,960
because I believed you
would return someday.

149
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,170
It's been thirty years since you left in
search of the perfect flowing noodles.

150
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,920
Did you find them?

151
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,260
I've eaten so many kinds of noodles,

152
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,390
I just don't know anymore...

153
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,390
I raided our savings to take this trip,

154
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,640
but the money's run out.

155
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,190
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,860
Please let the flowing noodles slide.

157
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,610
I will.

158
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,530
What are you looking at?!

159
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,990
This isn't a show!

160
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm sorry,

161
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,790
but could you make like a
flowing noodle and flow away?

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,470
The first-years are all here?

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,390
Listen up.

165
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,390
Some people respond to praise,
and others respond to criticism.

166
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,390
I'll use my intuition to tell you apart.

167
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,770
Got it?

168
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,900
<i>I respond to praise,</i>

What!?

173
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,800
What!?

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,400
Nano!

176
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,520
Look, look. I tried
tying up my hair.

177
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,690
Does it look good?

178
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,910
Professor! You look
a bit more mature.

180
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,660
Hey, how much more
mature do I look?

181
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,960
What? You look pretty mature.

182
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,630
What about you?
How mature are you?

183
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,550
Oh, well... I don't
think I'm that mature.

184
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,640
Whoops! Yeah, I guess you aren't.

185
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,390
I'll have to clean this up for you.

186
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,060
And this.

187
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,240
Oh, Nano...

188
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm still reading that...

189
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,280
Oh, Nano.

190
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,830
You, too, Sakamoto.

191
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,170
What are you doing?

192
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,420
You'll catch a cold.

193
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,260
What's gotten into you?
What are you planning?

194
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,760
Sakamoto...

195
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,720
What?

196
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,340
You'll catch a cold.

197
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,600
No, I won't!

198
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,430
If you're going to put
something on me, use a blanket.

199
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,850
Why would you use a book?

200
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,270
Sakamoto, you're always complaining.

201
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,860
What do you think you're doing?

202
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,610
I'll go do the laundry.

203
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,320
I'll do it.

204
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,160
It's okay, Professor.
I just have to turn the dial.

205
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,620
You're hopeless.
I'll turn it for you.

206
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,210
No, really. I just have to turn it...

207
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,590
I said I'd turn it, so I'm turning it!

208
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,920
U-um...

209
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,050
Thanks, I guess.

210
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,610
If you need anything
else, let me know.

211
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,320
O-okay.

212
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,490
Hooray!

213
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,830
Oh, dear.

214
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Nano, you're
hopeless. Let me cook.

215
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,610
Oh, it's okay. I'm making
something right now...

216
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,650
I'll make something better.

217
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,400
No, wait! That's dangerous!

218
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,440
Come on. I'll do it.
No, wait! That's dangerous!

219
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,070
It's okay.

220
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:30,860
No, it's not okay. Really!

221
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,320
Come on, come on.

222
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,740
Really, Professor. No!

223
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,000
Ow!

224
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,750
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

225
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,340
Are you okay, Mr. Sakamoto?

226
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,130
What are you doing?!

227
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,010
I-I'm sorry!

228
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,340
Sakamoto, you're hopeless,
walking there like that.

229
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm not the hopeless one!
You two are the ones messing around!

230
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,600
Now now, Sakamoto, getting
angry won't help anything.

231
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,350
That doesn't make any sense!

232
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,770
Let's just make it again.

233
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,770
I'll do it.

234
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,530
No, the rest of the food will get cold,

235
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,900
so I'll make it quickly.

236
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,200
Oh, Nano... I'll do it.

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,240
Professor! That's dangerous!

238
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,290
You'll drop an egg!

239
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,540
It's okay.

240
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,410
Hey, watch out!

241
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,710
It's fine...

242
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,670
You're hopeless.

243
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,300
You're the hopeless one!

244
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,630
What's with this kid today?

245
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,010
I think she's trying to act mature.

246
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,850
I am mature.

247
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,480
Hey, kid.

248
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,770
What?

249
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,110
Did you know that mature
people don't eat snacks?

250
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,280
Ta-dah! It's actually just me!

251
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,830
Liar.

252
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,050
River Fishing

253
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,920
I hooked a big one!

254
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,800
A boot!

255
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,520
This is it!

256
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,850
A kettle!

257
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,690
This stuff's crazier than
fish would be, right?

258
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,280
If I knew I'd have this much fun,

259
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,740
I'd have invited someone else.

260
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,280
I'll come back.

261
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,510

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>I don't want to do my homework...</i>

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm a frill-necked lizard.

346
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,510
It might take a
couple of extra sheets

347
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,390
before you figure
out how to make me.

348
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,510
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 11.
