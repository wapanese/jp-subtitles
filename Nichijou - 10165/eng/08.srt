1
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,870
What beautiful weather.

2
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,870
I should wake the
professor up soon.

3
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,720
Maybe I'll go for a
walk after breakfast.

4
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,850
Huh? What...

5
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,830
Tattaima hajimete kizuita
I only just noticed

6
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,500
that I fell in love
Koi ni ochita no da naa

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,130
You are on my mind all day, day, day
24h kimiOkimiOkimiO

8
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,920
and I can't do anything about it
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen!

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,380
Somehow
Nanka

10
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,130
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

11
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,970
with you
Futari

12
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,760
you seem different from usual, could it be...
Gikochinai kaiwa masaka

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Mutual love?
Ryouomoi

14
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,970
Nah, it's one-sided
Iya kataomoi

15
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,600
Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

16
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,230
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

17
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,150
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,200
This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,830
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kanaa

20
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,620
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

21
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,250
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

22
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,960
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,630
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

24
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,340
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation
Yayayacchatta kaiwa kami makuri

25
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,930
Awkward silence, mmhmmhmhm
Kimazui chinmoku mamimumemo

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,840
I want
Kimi no

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,470
to know your feelings
Kimochi shiritai yo

28
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,390
O-o-one-one-sided love
KakakataOkataomoi

29
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,470
My first love
Hatsukoi!!

30
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,310
on my normal way to school
Itsumo no tsuugakuro

31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,640
glitters brightly
Pikapika hikaru

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,730
I DO fall in love!

33
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,400
I feel like I can fly in the sky
Sora mo tobesou sa

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,690
O-o-one-one-sided love

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,080
Mio, Mai. Selamat pagi.

37
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,870
Yukko, good morning.

38
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,920
Good morning.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,580
It's nice outside today.

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,090
Yesterday, they
said it would rain.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,800
Well, the weather's not real bad...

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,760
so maybe I should buy a keypad!

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,890
Just kidding.

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,060
<i>Wha-wha-what's with
their lack of reaction?</i>

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,520
<i>Terrible... these girls are terrible...</i>

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,650
<i>Could they think that I'm...</i>

47
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,030
<i>actually going to buy a keypad?</i>

48
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,660
<i>Oh, that's it.</i>

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,280
<i>That joke was a little
too highbrow for them.</i>

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,990
<i>I need to make jokes that
everyone can understand.</i>

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,660
<i>Okay!</i>

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,910
Man, it sure is hot.

53
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,330
This hot spot...

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,250
is giving me a bald spot!

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Just kidding.

56
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,720
<i>Terrifying, terrifying...</i>

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,850
<i>the virtual age is terrifying!</i>

58
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,180
<i>But, I guess...</i>

59
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,980
<i>it's in bad taste if they know
someone who's really balding.</i>

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,850
Wait!

61
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,600
<i>I feel a little guilty.</i>

62
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,270
<i>All right!</i>

63
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,820
<i>I'll use the ancient weapon!</i>

64
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,980
<i>The noble treasure!</i>

65
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,990
Hey, listen!

66
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,870
What did the man say when
a centipede attacked him?

67
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,370
"This bug's...

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
really bugging me!"

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,250
<i>I'm shocked!</i>

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,330
<i>I'm shocked...</i>

71
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,960
What's wrong with these girls?

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
<i>How can they still
keep a straight face?</i>

73
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,510
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

74
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,760
<i>Maybe they didn't hear me.</i>

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,850
<i>If they didn't hear me,
it's not their fault.</i>

76
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,890
<i>All right!</i>

77
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen!

78
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,060
What did the man say when
a centipede attacked him?

79
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,310
"This bug's...

80
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,070
really bugging me!"

81
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,700
<i>These girls are true warriors...</i>

82
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,950
<i>no, they're on the level of kings!</i>

83
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,490
<i>Could it be...</i>

84
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,580
<i>Could it be that they're expecting me to
surpass my own level of skill,</i>

85
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,050
<i>to surpass...</i>

86
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,550
<i>myself?!</i>

87
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,100
<i>If I give up here...</i>

88
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,010
<i>I'll betray their expectations!</i>

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,930
<i>I can't turn back!</i>

90
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,690
<i>Can't turn back!</i>

91
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,440
<i>So...</i>

92
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,280
<i>I can't...</i>

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,860
give in!

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,530
My grade for astronomy will be...

95
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,830
...astronomical!

96
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,190
I've got an explosive desire
to visit a bomb shelter!

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,810
The gully is happy! Golly!

98
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,070
I'll... make... you... see...

99
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,990
my makeup!

100
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,470
In this equation,
substitute this for <i>x</i>

101
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,550
to determine the answer.

102
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,430
Take this <i>y</i>, and...

President.

105
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,200
Ogi!

106
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,950
Why haven't we seen
you around for so long?

107
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,200
For the last three months,
I thought you were dead.

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,450
How've you been?

109
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,410
Yes.

110
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,290
You've got great timing.
I've got nothing to do.

111
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,670
Let's do something together.

112
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,670
What do you want to do?

113
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,130
We can play this.

114
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,340
I came to quit the club.

115
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,390
Popcorn

116
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,030

117
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,870
<i>Why do I cough</i>

118
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,910
<i>just before the movie starts,</i>

119
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,410
<i>at the movie theater?</i>

120
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,760
And then I...

121
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,300
Weboshi! Fet!

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,010
Have you seen Sasahara?

123
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,180
Sasahara?

124
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,810
I saw him taking the
stairs up to the roof.

125
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,890
Thanks!

126
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,640
Misato's already
busy this morning.

127
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,480
That's youth for you...

128
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,690
Let's go take a look.

129
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,190
They might be up to something!

131
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:29,980
They might be up to something!

132
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,290
<i>Across the blue sky,</i>

133
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,830
<i>a single flying right hand</i>

<i>leaves a trail of clouds.</i>

135
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,080
<i>Sasahara.</i>

136
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,500
Not bad.

137
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,710
Sasahara, do you understand
what you've done?

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,720
The weather is beautiful,

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,140
so I came up to the
roof to compose a poem.

140
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,430
Not that.

141
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,970
I'm talking about this.

142
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,390
Don't you remember this?

143
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,310
That's mine.

144
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,400
Why do you have...

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,860
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,320
I picked up your litter for you!

147
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,110
Oh no, I did not throw this away.

148
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,650
I simply dropped it by accident.

149
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,780
This is not garbage.

150
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,490
It's a handker-

151
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,830
Everything you own is garbage!

152
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,250
How did you know this was mine?

153
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,750
Our homes are in completely
opposite directions.

154
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,210
You even ironed it...

155
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,600
A-are you stupid?
Don't get the wrong idea!

156
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,100
I just happened to
be walking that way,

157
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,980
while I was thinking about stuff!

158
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,660
Thank you for your
kindness, Tachibana Misato.

159
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,130
You always drop
things in the morning...

160
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,010
I never noticed. Do I?

161
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,300
You're littering the streets!

162
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,100
B-but... I don't mind...

163
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,650
picking up your garbage for you...

164
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,190
Don't get the wrong idea!

165
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,200
That's just my
volunteer spirit talking!

166
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,260
Misato's never going to change.

167
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,840
Weboshi...

168
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,550
What do I do with this?

169
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,800
Why did you bring that?

170
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,100
What do I do with it?

171
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,180
Get rid of it!

172
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,060
But what do I do with it?

173
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,560
Just get rid of it!

174
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,440
But what do I do with it?

175
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,900
Things we think are cool!

176
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
Super-car bicycles!

178
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,510

181
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,060
No one's coming to save us.

182
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,110
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 33

183
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
There is no God.

184
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,960
No Buddha.

185
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,470
Yesterday, I had...

186
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,230
...pork cutlet?

187
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,280
Oh, well.

188
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,640
Huh?

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,560
How long have we been here?

190
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,750
I think...

191
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,080
...I just fell asleep.

192
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,590
Oh, well.

193
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,360
Do you want to play shiritori?

194
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,360
Orange.

195
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,330
Oh, sorry.

196
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,790
Say it one more time.

197
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,300
What did I say?

198
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,010
Say.

199
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,810
Say.

200
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,310
Say.

201
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,820
Can I say something
totally different?

202
00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:39,080
Eggplant.

203
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,830
She's dead.

204
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,050
Help isn't coming.

205
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,060
<i>I'm paralyzed.</i>

206
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,070
Go-Soccer Club Part 6

207
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,940
It's down to just
you and me, Sekiguchi.

208
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,860
We'll have to disband

209
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,620
if we don't have at
least three members.

210
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,000
If only we had a way
to recruit members...

211
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,250
President.

212
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,790
What does our club do?

213
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, I thought you came up with a good way to recruit people.

214
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,300
We don't really do anything.

215
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Start

216
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,760
On your mark...
Start

217
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Start

218
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,810
Get set...

219
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,020
Go!

220
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,150
Stop! Hey! Don't take my uniform!

221
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,740
Come on, Seki.

222
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,450
Give me your uniform.

223
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,540
B-but I haven't even
scored a single point today!

224
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,700
I don't care.

225
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,460
This uniform commemorates your retirement!

226
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,630
B-but the uniform of a player who couldn't score a single point in their last game must be worthless!

227
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,550
That's not true.

228
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,220
I started playing
soccer because of you!

229
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,800
W-wait! Fine! Fine!

230
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,760
Just let me take it off
when I'm ready, okay? Okay?

231
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,890
Just let go of me!

232
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,850
What?

233
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,690
Fine...

234
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,690
There's my opening!

235
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,110
This is my way of life!!

236
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,030
Sorry, I guess...

237
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,290
Tail

238
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,580
Listen up!

239
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,420
From now on, be sure
to respect your elders.

240
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,170
Okay.

241
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,100
Geez, she's completely hopeless.

242
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,040
Oh, man! This is so fun!

243
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Wait up!

244
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,540
Go-Soccer Club Part 7

245
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,670
In the beginning,
I thought I could make a

246
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,760
new kind of club,
combining go and soccer.

247
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,430
Smells Like Youth
Soccer of the East
Go of the West

248
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,470
That's why I made this club.

249
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,390
But...

250
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,270
I couldn't come up
with any good ideas.

251
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,860
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 34

252
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,490
First you draw a boomerang,

253
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,450
then a triangle, and then a square...

254
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,700
Professor, let's go to bed.

255
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,820
Okay!

256
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,660
Professor, did you have a snack?

257
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,540
No, I didn't.

258
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,290
Why did you look away?

259
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,630
I might have looked away.

260
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,250
That doesn't make any sense!

261
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,010
Look! Why are you
having a snack before bed?

262
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,470
Well, that wasn't me, so...

263
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,220
Who am I looking at, with
crumbs all over her face?

264
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,730
I think I caught a cold.

265
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,020
What are you doing?

266
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,730
Why do you keep eating snacks
before bed even when I tell you not to?

267
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,900
It's not my fault!

268
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,240
Sakamoto told me to eat it!

269
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,330
He's making a snot
bubble. How silly.

270
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,950
Don't change the subject!

271
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,470
Sheesh.

272
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,300
Brush your teeth before
you go to bed, okay?

273
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,800
I already brushed my teeth.

274
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,270
You mean you brushed your
teeth before your snack?

275
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,060
Yes. I brushed them.

276
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,560
Why are you embarrassed?

277
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,690
But you only have to
brush your teeth once.

278
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,440
That's not true! You had a snack.

279
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,650
Then, did you brush your teeth?

280
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,570
I brushed them!

281
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,870
Then, then...

282
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm ready to go to bed.

283
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,200
You're the one who isn't ready.

284
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,380
You're a robot, so
you can't get cavities!

285
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,220
Nano, um, uh...

286
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,100
You might get a little cavity.

287
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,510
Really?

288
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,520
Really.

289
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,390
You're lying...

290
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,770
Oh, but you can rust, though!

291
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,560
Rust...

292
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,980
Uh, um...

293
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,570
I'll give you a cavity feature!

294
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,240
Don't worry. I'll really do it!

295
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,530
Promise?

296
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,750
That's the truth!

297
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,760
Nano, come brush
your teeth with me!

298
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,510
Okay. It's my second time, though.

299
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,010
It's already 10 PM.

300
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,010
Yes, it is.

301
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,640
Let's go to sleep after this.

302
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,950
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

303
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:54,040
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

304
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,380
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

305
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,170
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

306
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:13,010
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

307
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:19,100
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

308
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:25,320
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

309
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:35,250
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,170
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

311
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:50,430
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

312
00:22:50,430 --> 00:23:00,520
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

313
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,740
A Little Miracle

314
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,200
Geez, Sasahara never
takes anything seriously...

315
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,210
We're a double-yolked egg!

316
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,090
We are!

317
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,180
Hot... Hot, hot, hot!

318
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,010
Hot! Hot!

319
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,510
The... the next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is e-episode 9.
