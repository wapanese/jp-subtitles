00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,900
Can we stop by the fire cistern?

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,070
There you go again.

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,860

go to places like that!

By the way, Mai,

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,370
want to stop by

00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,920

system quite a bit.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,460
It might be kinda tough for you.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,840
So I'll show you how it works.

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,860
Mai.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,940
That...

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,150
It's asymmetry.

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,610
Yeah, I see that!

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,160
That's completely beside the point!

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,120
It's way beyond
fashionable asymmetry!

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,490

Hello, I'm a crow.

82
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,910
It's a pleasure to meet you.

83
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,250
It's a good thing
he's so polite.

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,500
That's because he's a crow.

85
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,710
The pleasure is mine.

86
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,880
I wonder if he'd
drink strawberry milk.

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,960
Do you think he might?

88
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,050
It'd be cute if he did.

89
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,890
Unbelievable.

90
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,770
He killed a bug for us.

91
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,820
No need to thank me.
It's just part of my job.

92
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,900
What a crow.

93
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,030
Mr. Sakamoto,
where's your scarf?

94
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,240
Without his scarf,
we can't understand him!

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,700
I shall listen and
interpret for him.

96

Hm, hm.

98
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,920
It seems that he
would like my scarf.

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,760

100
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,130
<i>It isn't yours!</i>

101
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,980
Professor, did you give
Mr. Sakamoto's scarf to the crow?

102
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,610
Such a shame.

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,660
But what about
poor Mr. Sakamoto?

104
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,830
I know... I'll make one.

105
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,950
A splendid idea.

106
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,120

<i>That has nothing

109
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,670
Excuse me, Professor.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,500
What are Biscuit #1's functions?

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,170
Good question, Crow!

112
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,510
It has a rocket punch!

113
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,970

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,140

Launch!

116
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,690
Professor, you should return
Mr. Sakamoto's s-scarf...

117
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,900
Hold on.

118
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,660
It still has its left hand!

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,700

120
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,160

123
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,340
But it appears my shenanigans have gone on long enough.

124
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,350
Please return this
scarf to Mr. Sakamoto.

125
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,180

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,440
Perhaps we shall meet again...

130
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,780

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,530
<i>Why am I cheering?!</i>

177
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,690
Uh...

178
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,320
Sorry, sorry.
Please forget about it.

179
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,450
Oh, right! You play Go-Soccer?

180
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,370
Yeah, I do...

181
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,500
Hey, Teacher...

182
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,500
you like my sister, don't you?

183
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,720
Don't be ridiculous!

184
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
I just happen to have
more Go-Soccer experience!

185
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,890
Teacher! You played Go-Soccer?

186
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,390
Of course I did!

187
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,350
Believe it or not,
I was my high school's MVP!

188
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,980
Teacher, our Go-Soccer club
doesn't have a faculty advisor.

189
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,400
If you'd be our advisor,

190
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,240
I'd do everything I could to
hook you up with my sister.

191
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,950
But it's... not like I like her...

192
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,080
If you won't be our advisor,

193
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,910
I'll tell everyone you like my sister.

194
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,040
Why, you little...

195
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,290
What'll it be?

196
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,960
Will you become our advisor?

197
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,170
Um...

198
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,710
Or will you not?

199
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,920
Um, but being an
advisor's a lot of work...

200
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,430
Hey, everyone! Listen up!

201
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,430
<i>Gonna move!</i>

202
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,640
<i>A-after him!</i>

203
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
Teacher!

204
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Nakanojo's been buried
behind the gymnasium...

205
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,770
What?!

206
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,560
You have to come right away!

207
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Hey, Mr. Takasaki is...

208
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,020
Teacher!

209
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,450
Listen closely.

210
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,160
Okay.

211
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,950
Nakanojo hasn't been buried!

212
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,830
What?

213
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,620
That's right! It could
just be a hole-in-one!

214
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,580
What?

215
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,130
But his hair came off!

216
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,790
What?!

217
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,670
Draw it in!

218
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,040
What?

219
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
I'll try it.

220
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,710
What?!

221
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,420
Hold on!

222
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,340
What?

223
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,380
What is the meaning of that?

224
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,220
Hey, tea.

225
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,430
A student exposing

226
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,600
another's private life
requires my attention,

227
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,180
over a buried student,

228
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,890
as, a... uh, as a teacher!

229
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,100
Mr. Takasaki!

230
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,730
Yes?

231
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,730
I haven't said anything.

232
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,730
I look forward to
having you as our advisor.

233
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,320
That kid...

234
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,070
Annaka! Let's go!

235
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,660
Okay.

237

238
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,620
It's this way!

239
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
<i>That way...</i>

240
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,630
<i>I know I was caught up in the moment,</i>

241
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,340

242
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,090

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,950
but nostalgia sprouted, somewhere inside.
<i>If she's reading this, then...</i>

358
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,370
but nostalgia sprouted, somewhere inside.

359
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,410
<i>Then...
but nostalgia sprouted, somewhere inside.</i>

360
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,410
He drew a cigarette from his breast pocket and lit it with the spark from a rock.
<i>Then...</i>

361
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,660
He drew a cigarette from his breast pocket and lit it with the spark from a rock.

362
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,910
<i>Then...
He drew a cigarette from his breast pocket and lit it with the spark from a rock.</i>

363
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,170
She memorized it?!

364
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,360
<i>Calling the joke out...</i>

365
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,030
<i>It feels... so...</i>

366
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,210
<i>...wonderful!</i>

367
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,930
I'm sorry I shouted.

368
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,890
I'll go and stand in the hallway!

369
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,520
O-Okay.

370
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,980
<i>Yes. This is how it should be.</i>

371
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,860
<i>This is my path, and...</i>

372
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,740
<i>This is Mai's path.</i>

373
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,700
Yukko.

374
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,330
Since this morning, I've been wearing...

375
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,080
contact lenses.

376
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,970
Then what's the point
of those glasses?

377
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,980
Heated Table

378
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,360
Professor, Professor.

379
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,370
If you don't sleep in your
bed, you'll catch a cold.

380
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,830
Professor...

381
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,080
Just a little longer...

382
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,960
Huh? A little longer?

383
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,130
She got me!

384
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,810
Makka na taiyou shizumu sabaku ni
In a desert baked by the scorching sun

385
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:47,400
Ookina kaijuu ga nombiri kurashiteta
a large monster lived free of cares

386
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,740
Aru asa mezametara
When one morning it awoke

387
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:57,330
Tooku ni kyaraban no suzu no oto kikoeta yo
It heard the bells of a caravan from far away

388
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,580
Omowazu sakenda yo
Without giving it much thought, it screamed

389
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:07,170
Umi ga mitai hito wo ai shitai
"I want to see the ocean, I want to love someone!"

390
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:16,180
Kaijuu ni mo kokoro wa aru no sa
"Even monsters have a heart!"

391
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:22,730
Dekakeyou sabaku sutete
"I will leave and abandon the desert"

392
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:33,030
Ai to umi no aru tokoro
"and go where I may find the ocean and my love"

393
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,620
A new sun burns down
Atarashii taiyou wa moeru

394
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:53,050
where it may find the ocean and its love
Ai to umi no aru tokoro

395
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,970
Short Thoughts

396
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,640
There we go.

397
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,020
Mr. Sakamoto...

398
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,520
Mr. Sakamoto, let's go to bed.

399
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,400
Okay.

400
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,860
She always ends up
carrying her to bed.

401
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,120
Three of spades here!

402
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,790
In the  President game, I begin as the weakest card.
But with a revolution, I become the strongest!

403
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,130
A real man overthrows his superiors.

404
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,500
The  next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 18.

406
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,630
