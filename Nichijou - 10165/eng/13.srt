1
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,620
<i>I'm hungry...</i>

2
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,580
<i>That kid is up to
something ridiculous again.</i>

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,590
<i>Well, I guess I wouldn't mind
falling for a trap like this.</i>

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,090
<i>The bait's worth it.</i>

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,880
You fell for it! You fell for it!

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,220
<i>Damn it... she really got me!</i>

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,140
This was going to be for lunch.

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,400
Now we don't have anything.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,810
Sakamoto...

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,900
You're guilty, too!

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,320
No, you said you
wanted to eat it.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,780
I didn't say that!

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,610
Good morning.

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,650
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,660
But you ate it.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,740
It's hot again today.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
After school, let's get
ice cream near the station.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,660
Good idea.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,920
Hey, kid.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,210
Don't you think the girl
wants to go to school?

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,850
Don't go!

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,180
What's gotten into you?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,430
He said you'd leave me.

24
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,650
What? Who told you that?

25
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,690
Sakamoto.

26
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,940
That's not what I said!

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,820
Nano, are you going somewhere?

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,200
I was thinking of
going shopping soon.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,740
We don't have
anything for lunch now.

30
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,290
I'll go with you!

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,580
I'm not buying you anything.

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,370
I want shark chocolate!

33
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,330
No.

34
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,830
Buy some shark chocolate!

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,840
I told you, I'm not
buying you anything.

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,500
Come on, buy some!

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,920
No.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,420
Sakamoto said to buy some.

39
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,670
I never said that.

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,770
Tattaima hajimete kizuita
I only just noticed

41
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,400
that I fell in love
Koi ni ochita no da naa

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,030
You are on my mind all day, day, day
24h kimiOkimiOkimiO

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,860
and I can't do anything about it
Ishiki sezaru wo emasen!

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,280
Somehow
Nanka

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,080
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,870
with you
Futari

47
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,700
you seem different from usual, could it be...
Gikochinai kaiwa masaka

48
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,660
Mutual love?
Ryouomoi

49
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,910
Nah, it's one-sided
Iya kataomoi

50
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,500
Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

51
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,130
What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

52
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,050
My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

53
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,100
This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

54
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,770
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kanaa

55
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,520
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,150
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,900
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

58
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,530
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

59
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,240
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation
Yayayacchatta kaiwa kami makuri

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,830
Awkward silence, mmhmmhmhm
Kimazui chinmoku mamimumemo

61
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,750
I want
Kimi no

62
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,420
to know your feelings
Kimochi shiritai yo

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,330
O-o-one-one-sided love
KakakataOkataomoi

64
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,380
My first love
Hatsukoi!!

65
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,250
on my normal way to school
Itsumo no tsuugakuro

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,550
glitters brightly
Pikapika hikaru

67
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,670
I DO fall in love!

68
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,340
I feel like I can fly in the sky
Sora mo tobesou sa

69
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,600
O-o-one-one-sided love
KakakataOkataomoi

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,940
Mio, good morning...

71
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,730
What's wrong, Yukko?
You can barely stand!

72
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,990
Since I woke up,
now that ya mention it...

73
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,490
Your speech is broken.

74
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,660
You look feverish.

75
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Why did you come
to school like this?

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,170
Well,

77
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,880
you know...

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,710
I thought I'd perform that
magic trick I told you about...

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,760
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 53

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,390
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,260
This is the first I've heard of it.

82
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,730
This isn't the time for magic.

83
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,850
But I practiced.

84
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,900
When you see my magic,

85
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,570
you won't believe your eyes...

86
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,530
It'll be great—

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,700
I already can't believe my eyes.

88
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,280
Why don't you sit d—

89
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,370
<i>Yukko...</i>

90
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,370
<i>I...</i>

91
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,920
<i>already see the trick!</i>

92
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,290
<i>I'll just pretend
I didn't see anything.</i>

93
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,420
<i>She came all the way
here in her condition.</i>

94
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,590
<i>But why is Yukko
trying to show off a...</i>

95
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,390
<i>I-it's out in the open!</i>

96
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,310
<i>Your trick is out in the open!</i>

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,900
<i>It flew away!</i>

98
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Tissues...

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,670
All right, here we go...

100
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,170
O-okay.

101
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,300
<i>Geez, what am I doing?</i>

102
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,010
<i>I just grabbed that on instinct...</i>

103
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,640
So... okay... first...

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,980
<i>She hasn't noticed that the
dove and the stick are missing.</i>

105
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,230
<i>How sick are you?</i>

106
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,230
I'll pass a cigarette
through a hundred yen coin.

107
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,650
<i>The hole... is already open.</i>

108
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,950
<i>They're all... aces of hearts.</i>

109
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,380
<i>Right now,</i>

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,470
<i>something flew out of her mouth...</i>

111
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,200
<i>What sort of trick
are you trying to...</i>

112
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,620
Yukko!

113
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,580
<i>Yukko...</i>

114
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,550
<i>Rest in peace.</i>

115
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm off to the supermarket.
Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 54

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,600
I'll go with you!

117
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,350
You didn't behave,

118
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,310
so I'm not buying
you anything today.

119
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,690
Poor Sakamoto.

120
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,110
She's talking to you.

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,110
Let's go.

122
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,950
What are you buying?

123
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,360
Fish, I suppose.

124
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,120
I wonder what I should get...

125
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,740
What? Not today, Professor.

126
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,710
What? But it's not a snack.

127
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,420
Even if it's not a snack,
I'm not buying it.

128
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,420
Then I don't know what to buy.

129
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,550
You're set on buying
something, aren't you?

130
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,510
Shark Sponge Cake

131
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,550
Nano! It's shark sponge cake.

132
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,260
Shark Sponge Cake

133
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,430
It's a food stand.

134
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,890
They look pretty
good. Let's try some.

135
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,310
Did you forget
already? Not today.
Shark Sponge Cake

136
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,440
But I'm buying it for Sakamoto.

137
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,570
Mr. Sakamoto also misbehaved,
so he doesn't get anything, either.

138
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,450
But I meant it's really for you...

139
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,780
I made a mistake.

140
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,870
I said no!

141
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,250
<i>If I give in now,
she'll just do this again.</i>

142
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,460
All right, Professor. Let's go.

143
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,380
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!

144
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,510
<i>I must steel my heart!</i>

145
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,600
<i>But...</i>

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,390
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!

147
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,810
<i>But I have to...</i>

148
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,680
<i>But...</i>

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,100
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!

150
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,400
<i>No, no. I mustn't.</i>

151
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,060
<i>Maybe a little...</i>

152
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,520
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!

153
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,110
<i>No! No!</i>

154
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,650
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
<i>But...</i>

155
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,940
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!

156
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,320
No, no...

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,410
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
<i>But...</i>

158
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,040
Delicious!

159
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,540
You bought her something.

160
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,710
I'm sorry. I lost.

161
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,380
<i>This kid is always throwing
tantrums to get her way.</i>

162
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,260
<i>Maybe I should scold her.</i>

163
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,880
Hey, kid. Why don't you
learn some self-control?

164
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,930
I have!

165
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,220
No, you haven't!

166
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,520
The Shinonome household
passed another peaceful day.

167
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,660
80 Point Mongolian

168
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,790
80 points is great!

169
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,200
If you really try, you can do it.

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,330
Well...

171
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,290
What is it?

172
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,120
What's the secret
behind your high score?

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, there's no secret!

174
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,550
What? Come on,
tell me your secret...

175
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,260
80 points, 80 points.

176
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,300
Hey, Yukko. Ow...
80 points, 80 points.

177
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,760
Stop it!

178
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,970
Secret

179
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,600
Ow...
Secret

180
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,760
Ow...

181
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,730
Do you want me to tell
you how I got 80 points?

182
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,440
I don't really care. I got a 96.

183
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,400
80 points...

184
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,320
It takes tremendous effort...

185
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,820
...and heart.

186
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,950
Shut up.

187
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,700
A Little Miracle

188
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,210
<i>Aioi.</i>

189
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,710
<i>Uh...</i>

190
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,220
<i>What...?</i>

191
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,970
<i>What...?</i>

192
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,400
<i>Hooray!!</i>

193
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,980
Contemporary Japanese Quiz
<i>Hooray!!</i>

194
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,740
Reality

195
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,000
Dad, I'm here to make dinner.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,910
Mom's still traveling, isn't she?

197
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,120
Thank you.

198
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,630
Hello.

199
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,840
Hello, Mi.

200
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,130
<i>I'll play with my
grandson all day,</i>

201
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,340
<i>and forget the troubles of reality.</i>

202
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,140
Mi, what do you want to do today?

203
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,640
Hey, hey, where's our official seal?

204
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,350
What?

205
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,520
Hey, where's the official seal?

206
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,770
Where are you
hiding it? Tell me!

207
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,860
Is it in this bookshelf?

208
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,490
Hey, where's the seal?

209
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,070
Hey, where is it? Where is it?

210
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,530
This is... worse than reality...

211
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,490
Come out, come out,
wherever you are...

212
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,310
You're late!

213
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,650
What time did you think
you were supposed to get here?

214
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,860
Sorry, sorry.

215
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,270
I wanted to go on the bus,

216
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,240
but instead I went with the flow.

217
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,580
<i>Let's keep going all
the way to Okachimachi.</i>

218

Nichijou:
Everyday Life
Part 55

219
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
Nano...

220
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,940
Hey, Nano, Nano.

221
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,860
What is it, Professor?

222
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,830
I need to use the
bathroom a little bit.

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,620
Come with me.

224
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,540
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go.

225
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,210
Hey, Nano. Hey, hey...

226
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,630
Professor, that's not right.

227
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,760
What?

228
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,310
Borscht is a food!

229
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,190
Not that...

230
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,150
I need to use the bathroom.

231
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,070
Hey, Nano. Nano, hey...

232
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,040
Just go!

233
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,000
D-did you just...

234
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,340
It's okay. It was just a little.

235
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,300
Hurry up and go
to the bathroom.

236
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,810
I'm going to sleep.

237
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,150
Go!

238
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,280
Kindly, Sakamoto
did not say anything.

239
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,660
Geez, kids are so hopeless.

240
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,790
Going to the bathroom alone
at night during a storm...

241
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,290
is just too much for her.

242
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,660
Because she's just a kid.

243
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,840
I'll go with her,
and remind her...

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,550
just how grateful
she should be to me.

245
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,050
Hey, kid.

246
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,550
I'll go with you.

247
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,560
Sakamoto, you're small and
weak, so you don't have to.

248
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,780
<i>Don't you think the girl
wants to go to school?</i>

249
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,590
Huh? Professor,
you came over here?

250
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,920
Nano, let's go to the
bathroom together.

251
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,800
But I don't need to go...

252
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm just a little scared,
so let's go together.

253
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,400
Why didn't you wake me up?

254
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,110
I tried.

255
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,950
I hear banging.

256
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,160
Maybe someone's here.

257
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,210
It's probably just the chimney.

258
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,960
The rain's coming
down really hard.

259
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,630
Nano, what's wrong?

260
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,050
Hey, Nano. Hey.

261
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,470
Hey?

262
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,230
Professor... Professor...

263
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,690
There's thunder.

264
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,480
I'm here. It's okay.

265
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,240
Hurry up, so we
can go back to bed.

266
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,030
Okay.

267
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,870
It's scary to go alone,

268
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,870
but it's okay if we're together.

269
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,880
You're right.

270
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,180
Nano, do you want
to go to school?

271
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,390
What?

272
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,440
No, I'll stay at home.

273
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,940
But Sakamoto said
you wanted to go!

274
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,740
Well...

275
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,390
Things we think are cool!

276
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,520
80!

277
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,060
Ugh.

278
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,700
Short Thoughts

279
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,330
A month passes quickly,

280
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,160
but Sunday seems so far away.

281
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,300
Elated

282
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,130
Next stop, 80 points, 80 points.

283
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,050
The exit is on the right.

284
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,050
Shut up.

285
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,770
I'll sing you an 80s
number for 80 points.

286
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,560
Shut up.

287
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,690
80 points, huzzah!
80 points, huzzah!

288
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,940
Go to hell!

289
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,900
Eden

290
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,860
Quiet down!

291
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,990
I'm announcing the
average test score.

292
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,370
The average score
was 92 points!

293
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,580
Yukko.

294
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
Don't!

295
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,920
Just don't...

296
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,930
Excellent Luck

297
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,540
What are you doing, kid?!

298
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,960
What are you doing?

299
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,420
Stop playing around,
and help me fold the laundry.

300
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,430
Starting tomorrow,
you can go to school.

301
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,180
What?

302
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,440
Really?

303
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,770
Why? What's gotten into you?

304
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,990
It's the right thing to do.

305
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Hooray!

306
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,750
<i>Now I won't get scolded for
eating lots of snacks at lunch.</i>

307
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,970
But, Professor,

308
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,510
I can't wear an elementary
school bag with this.

309
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,600
You're going to high school.

310
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,140
But, Professor,

311
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,020
if you don't remove
my key, I can't go to...

312
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,320
Here's your uniform.

313
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,380
Professor, I love you!

314
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,930
Nano! Nano! Nano!
Nano! Nano! Nano!

315
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,390
Professor! Professor! Professor!

316
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,350
Nano! Nano! Nano!
Nano! Nano! Nano!

317
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,180
Professor! Professor! Professor!

318
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,390
Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano!

319
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,900
Professor! Professor! Professor!

320
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,520
Nano!

321
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Professor!

322
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,150
Nano!

323
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,110
Professor!

324
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,110
Nano! Nano!

325
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,150
Professor! Professor!

326
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,900
Professor!

327
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:11,890
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

328
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,940
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

329
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:24,320
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

330
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,070
When our eyes met, flutteringly... it must be coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au... guuzen da yo ne

331
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,960
It's not in me to say this is my first love!
Hatsukoi nante ienai kyara ja nainda mon!

332
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,920
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

333
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,220
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

334
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:59,140
Today was fun again, it must be love
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa koi shite da naa

335
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:08,110
I'm so happy, so happy. Nice to meet you, awakening love.
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashite koigokoro

336
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,370
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

337
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:24,380
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

338
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,050
I'm a string of international flags.

339
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,760
People often ask if I'm a string of
international flags, or the flags of all nations,

340
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,180
but both are correct.

341
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,890
"Don't worry about
the small things"

342
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,470
was the last thing my father said.

343
