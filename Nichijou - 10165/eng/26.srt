1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,140
Birthday

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,390
Hey, listen.
Birthday

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,480
Birthday

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,690
We should have a
birthday party for Nano!

5
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,820
Good idea. When?

6
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,650
Today.

7
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,860
Today?!

8
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,110
Don't tell me these
things at the last minute.

9
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,320
Sorry.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,830
What are we going to do?

11
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,580
I don't have anything prepared.

12
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,960
Well, it's not like it's really
Nano's birthday today.

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
You didn't ask her?

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,790
That's right.

15
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,630
What's right?

16
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,130
It's a surprise!

17
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,000
What do you mean?

18
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,800
The professor...

19
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,760
Let's celebrate the professor's
birthday, as well.

20
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,050
Good idea! We'll kill
two birds with one stone!

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,680
Let's do it!

22
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,850
<i>Well, good surprises are
fun to give and receive...</i>

23
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,110
All right, I've got it!

24
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,530
Let's buy a cake
on the way home!

25
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,480
All right!

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
Mai, are you okay with that?

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,700
I forgot my coin purse.

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,080
Oh, well. I guess Yukko and I will...

29
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,000
I forgot my wallet, too.

30
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,330
Mio, please!

31
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,260
I still haven't returned the money I lost at the amusement park...

32
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,010
I guess I'll give it back today.

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,050
I'll go tell Nano we're
celebrating her birthday!

34
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,930
What happened to the surprise?

35
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,850
You're such an idiot...

36
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,440
But Sasahara rejected you...

37
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,700
He didn't reject me!

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,570
But you ran away in tears...

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,870
Oh, that was...

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,280
I mean, just because
their arms were linked

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,790
doesn't mean they're dating!

42
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,620
I haven't asked him about it yet!

43
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,080
So it's not like he
rejected me at all!

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,250
So I haven't given
up on him at all!

45
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,210
I still totally like him!

46
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,560
Forget I said that!

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,930
Got it?

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,320
Okay!

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:13,860
I haven't forgotten anything.

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,820
Nichijou:
My Ordinary
Life, Part 110

51
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,450
Professor, I'll see you later.

52
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,200
Nano!

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,920
Wh-wh-what's wrong, Professor?

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,840
I just made a little
one, so I'll go get it.

55
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,720
Professor, what do you
mean by "a little one"?

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,390
The little one's, um...

57
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,360
Will my back be smooth?

58
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,610
It will...

59
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030
But the little one is...

60
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,620
Nano.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,120
Yes!

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,080
It's gone.

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
Nano, it'll be okay! Nano!

64
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,630
What are you shouting about
so early in the morning?

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,660
Kid! Why did you
set a trap here?

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,300
Sakamoto broke the little one!

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,890
Huh? Uh... no!

68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,770
No, um...

69
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Sakamoto, you made Nano cry!

70
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,440
No, no, no! It's your fault
for leaving it on the floor!

71
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,450
I'm going to school...

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,620
Nano, you forgot something...

73
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,790
Nano.

74
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,630
I can make a new one in no time.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,050
Can you make it by
the time I get home?

76
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,050
I can make a new one
in no time, so...

77
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,930
Professor!

78
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,390
I'm going to school!

79
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,640
Okay!

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,360
See you later!

81
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,480
See you later...

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,450
Principal

83
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh? How strange...
The Principal and
the Vice-Principal

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,330
Vice-Principal!

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,630
This statue was here
when I was principal...

86
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,170
How strange. Principal
Shinonome's statue should be here.

87
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,470
The pranks kids play these days
are so humorous and mischievous...

88
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,980
Or perhaps...

89
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,810
Could it be that I have advocates?

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,900
Vice-Principal, I brought the delivery.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,860
Is this where you wanted the statue?

92
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,330
Oh, um... I didn't...

93
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,250
Vice-Principal, is this...

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,180
Kids play such elaborate
jokes these days...

95
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,520
I-I'm sorry, but could you
take this statue away?

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,890
What?

97
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,420
You want me to cart
this cheap one away?

98
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,350
<i>Cheap?!</i>

99
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,230
Got it! I'll remove this
dull-looking one, too!

100
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,110
<i>Dull!</i>

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
Hey! He wants us to
take this lame one, too!

102
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,370
There, there, Vice-Principal...
don't let it get to you.

103
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,830
I'll take this and the gross one
away on the double!

104
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,580
<i>What?</i>

105
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,580
Go Soccer Club,
Part 8

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,890
Huh? It's unlocked...

107
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,560
You're here, Sekiguchi?

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,440
I wanted to get here first,

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,400
so I had the Blackbird rush me here.

110
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,520
What? Do you practice
in the mornings, too?

111
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,860
Um...

112
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,200
Uh... Um...

113
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,910
Yes...

114
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,450
Seriously?

115
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,470
Nichijou:
My Ordinary
Life, Part 111

116
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,350
I can't believe I have to
buy lunch for both of you...

117
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,060
Sorry.

118
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,270
Well, there's no way around it
if you don't have your wallet...

119
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,070
That's Mio for you!
So generous!

120
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,110
Are you okay?

121
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,160
Yukko, you hit too hard!

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,030
Sorry, sorry.

123
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,370
Sorry, Mai!

124
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,160
I'm fine...

125
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,210
By the way, Yukko, did you ask
Nano if we could visit her today?

126
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,800
I completely forgot!

127
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,760
Okay! I'll go tell her we're
celebrating her birthday!

128
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,850
Don't do that!

129
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,930
Just ask if we can
come over today!

130
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,180
I know.

131
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,060
No, you don't!

132
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,850
I'll do it!

133
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,820
I said I'd go.

134
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,650
No, I'll go!

135
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,440
I'll go.

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,150
No, me!

137
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,240
I'll go.

138
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,200
Hey! Mai, Mai!

139
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,990
A moment, please!

140
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,990
Just a moment, please!

141
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,830
Okay, I'll go talk to Nano.

142
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,580
Better late than never!

143
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,800
Ow!

144
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,930
Sorry!

145
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,850
Don't worry about it.

146
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,350
Go.

147
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm really sorry! Sorry!

148
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,070
I accidentally picked black coffee...

149
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,740
Sorry!

150
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,580
It's okay. Sorry.

151
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm really sorry!

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,910
Rainbow.

155
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,710
I found it!

156
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,440
Ouch...

157
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,940
Aioi, are you okay?

158
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,940
Nano, I've been looking for you.

159
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,150
What? Really?

160
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,490
Yeah, actually...

161
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Uh, this is just...

162
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,500
Are you okay? Did that hurt?

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,750
Uh, no. I'm fine...

164
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,170
Oh, good...

165
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,300
So, this isn't what you think. It's just...

166
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,430
Hey, forget that. Can we come
over to your house today?

167
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,050
Huh? Uh, yes.

168
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,470
Oh, right...

169
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,390
It's a surprise, so I can't explain.

170
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,690
Uh, um...

171
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,940
See you later.

172
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,400
Okay.

173
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,120
Maybe I'll buy some
for Aioi and the others.

174
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,670
First comes rock!
Then comes paper.

175
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,380
You can't throw all of them,

176
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,710
Rock, paper, scissors!

177
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,970
What's going on?

186
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,840
I've been looking
for you, Boss!

187
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,670
I'm glad you're...

188
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,800
Why are you running away?

189
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,090
Have you forgotten me?

190
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,840
<i>I'm running because
I haven't forgotten!</i>

191
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,720
Boss, it's dinner time.

192
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,680
Here.

193
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,310
What's wrong, Boss?

194
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,440
You're not going to eat?

195
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,740
What's wrong, Boss?

196
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,490
It's bath time.

197
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,620
There you go...

198
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,370
Boss!

199
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,040
Cats
with
Living

200
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,460
Shoot. If I don't
hurry, I'll be late.

201
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,620
Boss, I'll see you later.

202
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,420
Shoot.

203
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,180
Boss!

204
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Come here, Boss!

205
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,560
Boss!

206
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,230
<i>Just leave, already!</i>

207
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,270
Ms. Nakamura?

208
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,850
Hello.

209
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,560
Shinonome!

210
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,520
<i>Girl, do something!</i>

211
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,650
What's wrong?

212
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,530
You seem to be
looking for something.

213
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,450
<i>This robot really does
throw herself into danger.
You seem to be
looking for something.</i>

214
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,910
<i>This robot really does
throw herself into danger.</i>

215
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,740
<i>But I can see Shinonome
at school any time.</i>

216
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,250
<i>Right now, Boss comes first!</i>

217
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,120
Excuse me, Shinonome.

218
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,750
Have you seen a black cat?

219
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,290
Ms. Nakamura,
you have a black cat?

220
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,010
Yeah. But he ran away...

221
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,930
I have a black cat, too!

222
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,140
Really...

223
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,680
May I help you look?

224
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,180
Oh, thanks, Shinonome.

225
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,350
It's no problem.

226
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,890
<i>Are you stupid?</i>

227
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,940
Oh, Ms. Nakamura.

228
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,820
What's your cat's name?

229
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,780
It's Boss.

230
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,150
What an interesting name.

231
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,120
Our cat is called
Mr. Sakamoto.

232
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,120
What an unusual name.

233
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,580
It really is, isn't it?

234
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,250
Is he cute?

235
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,090
Is Boss cute?

236
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,590
What are you saying?

237
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,850
<i>Well, it's not like
Nakamura meant any harm...</i>

238
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,730
<i>but I'd never
survive in her care.</i>

239
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,940
Memories of Nakamura's
Poor Care
<i>but I'd never
survive in her care.</i>

240
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,860
<i>No, hold on...
</i><i>Memories of Nakamura's
Poor Care</i><i></i>

241
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:23,980
<i>No, hold on...</i>

242
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,020
<i>That's not any different
from how things are now, is it?</i>

243
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,610
Memories of the Kid's Pranks
<i>That's not any different
from how things are now, is it?</i>

244
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,570
<i>That's not any different
from how things are now, is it?</i>

245
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,610
<i>The scale won't budge.</i>

246
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,030
It's already this late?

247
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm sorry, Ms. Nakamura.

248
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,330
I've got to get going,
or the groceries...

249
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,210
Oh, I see...

250
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,500
If you find him,
can I come see Boss?

251
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,010
Yes, please do!
You can come any time!

252
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,840
Come tomorrow!

253
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,180
Please excuse me.

254
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,720
Sure!

255
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,850
<i>Damn it! My life sucks,
no matter where I go!</i>

256
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,980
Nichijou:
My Ordinary
Life, Part 113

257
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,900
Professor! Mr. Sakamoto! I'm home.

258
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Nano,

259
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,120
it's the little one!

260
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,870
You made it, professor?

261
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,830
Sakamoto stepped on it again!

262
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,460
Mr. Sakamoto...

263
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,050
Huh?

264
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,760
Are you sure you
want to remove it?

265
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,050
I'll make a new one right away!

266
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,510
Professor!

267
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,190
I never knew it
came off so easily.

268
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,940
I could never get it off myself...

269
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,360
That's because you
can't remove it yourself,

270
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,240
but other people can.

271
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>I see.</i>

272
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,620
But even you can
put it back on!

273
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,950
<i>What an unbelievable design...</i>

274
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,000
By the way, Professor, what
functions does that little one have?

275
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,630
If I remove this, your big toe
won't come off any more.

276
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,050
<i>I have a function
like that, don't I?</i>

277
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,420
Could that be Aioi
and the others?

278
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,300
Yukko?

279
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,260
Hooray, it's Yukko!

280
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,520
Oh, right. I should
put this key away...

281
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,900
<i>Now I finally look
like a normal person.</i>

282
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,650
<i>I wonder if I'll become
even closer with everyone.</i>

283
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,660
<i>Maybe I'll get to go out
with everyone more,</i>

284
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,540
<i>and live a more fun
and ordinary life!</i>

285
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,830
<i>Hey, forget that. Can we come
over to your house today?</i>

286
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,590
<i>Because it's cute.</i>

287
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,590
<i>Nano, you're just Nano.</i>

288
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>Isn't that enough?</i>

289
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,010
<i>I just came here
to tell you that.</i>

290
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,890
<i>But I forgot all about it.</i>

291
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,860
<i>Nano.</i>

292
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,280
<i>Girl.</i>

293
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,710
Shh! Quiet!

294
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,340
This is important!

295
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
I know, I know!

296
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,680
Ready, and...

297
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,050
Nano.

298
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,770
Ta-dah! Happy birthday!

299
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,810
We bought you a cake!

300
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,350
Aioi...

301
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,400
Happy birthday... huh? Why?

302
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,150
It's a surprise, a surprise.

303
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,490
Cake! I want cake!

304
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,240
Cake, cake, cake, cake!
Wait, Professor!
You're pulling too much!

305
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,700
Cake, cake, cake, cake!

306
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,660
Wait, Professor...
Cake, cake, cake, cake!

307
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,870
Now, now, Professor...
Cake, cake, cake, cake!

308
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,500
Unbelievable!

309
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,750
The cake...

310
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,500
What are we going
to do? Uh, um, uh...

311
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,590
I have another...

312
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,880
<i>Mai...</i>

313
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,840
What is that?

314
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,880
Hooray!

315
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,310
What? One more time!

316
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,820
But how did everyone
know it was my birthday?

317
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,030
Nano's
Birthday

318
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,370
Nano!

319
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,840
I made the little one!

320
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,170
Professor...

321
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,050
This key has certainly
been inconvenient,

322
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,050
and I really did want
to remove it, but...

323
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,810
I prefer things the way they are!

324
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,600
What?

325
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,610
This little one spins
when you're really happy!

326
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,200
What kind of key is that?

327
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,740
Oh, right.

328
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,290
Professor, could you
take this cake out?

329
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,670
More cake!

330
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,790
I'm going to bring out some tea.

331
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,250
Okay!

332
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,010
Cake, cake, cake, cake!

333
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,130
Professor?

334
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,510
Cake!

335
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,430
What are you two doing?

336
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,600
Cake, cake!
Aioi, are you okay?

337
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,270
Nano, get something to wipe this!

338
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,100
Okay!

339
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,310
Put a candle here...

340
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,360
No fair! I want to do it, too!

341
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
Mai, we have to clean it up first!

342
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,070
Something to wipe it,
something to wipe it...

343
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,580
Mai!

344
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,080
Uh, um, uh...

345
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,290
One more...

346
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,370
Stop it! We have to clean this!

347
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,500
Mai, stop, stop!

348
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,550
Uh, um, uh...

349
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,010
What is this? What is this?

350
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,010
Thank you...
What is this? What is this?

351
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,050
What is this? What is this?

352
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:58,330
The mountain ranges burn under the glaring light
shiroi hikari no naka ni yamanami wa moete

353
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,760
You fly to the farthest reaches of the sky

The endless blue of the sky shakes you

355
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:30,030
Fly, bird! You fly through freedom! Do not look back!
jiyuu wo kakeru tori yo furikaeru koto mo sezu

356
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:40,250
Put courage into your wings, ride the winds of hope

357
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:52,180

Motivation

359
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,070
What's wrong, Mio?

360
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,280
I can't stop sneezing.

361
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,200
What are you talking about?

362
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,460
Will those sneezes away.

363
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,540
And what do I do until
they're willed away?

364
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,090
Just stop them!

365
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,550
That's impossible.

366
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,510
What a simple moron.
