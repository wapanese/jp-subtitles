1
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,920
I've brought him here.

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,630
Enter.

3
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,390
Well, if it isn't King Albert.

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,690
Dolph...

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,860
What is the meaning of this?

6
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,950
I thought we could enjoy
a delicious meal together.

7
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,090
Unfortunately, it appears
there's no food for you.

8
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,840
Restrain him.

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,550
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,060
Is that what you're after?

11
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,150
Let's end this game
of hide-and-seek

12
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,030
with the princess, King Albert.

13
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,740
Or should I say Albert?

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,050
Did you find her?

15
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,550
No, I haven't!

16
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,760
I'll check over there!

17
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,180
Listen up!

18
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,850
Get the wooden cube.

19
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,560
Don't kill the princess yet.

20
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,690
Do you think your actions
can be forgiven, Dolph?

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,480
Forgiven?

22
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,900
Just who do you
think will punish me?

23
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,700
You no longer have
any allies here, Albert.

24
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,830
This trip around the
world that you planned...

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,170
was the greatest chance
you could have given me.

26
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,170
I was able to trap the young
princess with my subordinates.

27
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,880
Why? Why did you betray me, Dolph?

28
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,470
Don't say things like that, Albert.

29
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,180
I am grateful to you.

30
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,940
When I was an orphan,
you took me in and raised me,

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,730
and you even made me
your kingdom's commander!

32
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,020
Then why?

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,030
Do you think I supported you until
now with no ambition of my own?

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,670
This is simply the punishment
of our just God, Albert.

35
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,290
Commander Dolph!

36
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,880
We've found the princess!

37
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,630
Okay! I'll be right there!

38
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,090
There you have it.

39
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,140
I look forward to hearing
your last words, King Albert.

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,140
Traitor.

41
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,890
What are you doing?

42
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,270
Don't you know your place?

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,650
Well, if it isn't Princess Starla.

44
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,610
How do you do?

45
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,610
Dolph.

46
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,900
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

47
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,910
Your speech is always so vulgar, despite your appearance.

48
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,370
Of course I know what I'm doing.

49
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,290
I will take King Albert's wooden cube and your wooden cube,

50
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,000
and resurrect the ancient weapon.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,510
So that I may become the
Fey Kingdom's new king!

52
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,010
You have no friends here.

53
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,220
You cannot escape!

54
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,560
Now, be a good girl
and hand it over!

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,090
He... he's dead...

56
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:17,750
Princess! Princess!

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,210
Hey, you!

58
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,210
This is going to cost you!

59
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,840
Now, take me to my father!

60
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,440
The wooden cube?

61
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,860
I thought the princess had it.

62
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,610
No, it's probably...

63
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,030
<i>What?</i>

64
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,290
<i>Wait, what?!</i>

65
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,500
<i>What?</i>

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,920
<i>Does this mean I'll become king?</i>

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,840
<i>No... no, hold on. Calm down.</i>

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,510
<i>I need a cigarette.</i>

69
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,060
<i>For twelve years, I've been a soldier.</i>

70
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,350
<i>I always expected to die a soldier.</i>

71
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,690
<i>I never thought I'd
have a chance like this...</i>

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,960
<i>I can't do it.</i>

73
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,130
<i>I don't have a plan
for after I become king.</i>

74
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,180
<i>Even with both of these,</i>

75
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,600
<i>I don't know how to
summon the ancient weapon.</i>

76
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,850
Ow!

You're kidding!

85
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,550
Buy me something.

86

What should I buy?

87

Isn't today your birthday?

Here.

95
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,170
Really? A present!

96
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,630
Thank you!

97
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,090
Can I open it?

98
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,220
Yeah!

99
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,720
It's nothing special.

100
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
It was just lying around the house.

101
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,480
It's okay. It's the

Good morning.

107
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,080
Ms. Sakurai, is there anything
we can do about that Aioi girl?

108
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,250
That Aioi girl
Ms. Sakurai, is there anything

109
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,620
She never does her homework.
That Aioi girl

110
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,250
It would help if her homeroom teacher talked to her about it.

112
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,720
Sorry. I'll let Aioi know...

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,350
I need to get to my first period class.

114
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,680
Please take care of it!

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,310
Excuse me.

116
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,270
Are you all right?

118
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,480

<i>As a teacher, bringing romantic

130

Ms. Sakurai!

134
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,730
You forgot your black folder.

135
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,270
Ah, sorry for the trouble, Mr. Takasaki.

136
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,400
But this is my black folder.

137
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,070
What?

138
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,530
Mr. Takasaki!

139
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,660
Where are you taking
my black folder?

140
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,450
What?

141
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm sorry!

142
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,330
Well, please excuse me.

143
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,050
<i>I want to take her mushroom hunting!</i>

144
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,630

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,350

<i>Do I have a chance?</i>

147
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,600
<i>What kind of music does she like? What's her favorite animal?</i>

148

151
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,200
<i>A proper role model for the
students shouldn't be doing this!</i>

152
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,040
Mr. Takasaki, are you
worried about your students?

153
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,710
<i>But, isn't asking her what her
favorite food is innocent enough?</i>

154
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,750
<i>Ms. Sakurai, what's
your favorite food?</i>

155
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,010
<i>Um, I'll eat anything.</i>

156
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>Ha, I see. How do you feel
about shiitake mushrooms?</i>

157
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,510
<i>They're good grilled or boiled.</i>

158
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,470
<i>You're right. What about fried?</i>

159
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,600
<i>Of course you can fry them.</i>

160
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,270
<i>They're good fried, aren't they?</i>

161
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,940
<i>I can do it!</i>

162
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,730
<i>Act naturally! Naturally,
Takasaki Manabu!</i>

163
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,820
<i>Talk to her naturally, like
you're talking to eggplants!</i>

165
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,450

you again and again...

<i>What am I saying?!</i>

169
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,420
<i>Stupid! Am I stupid? Am I an idiot?</i>

170
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,300
No, I'm not.

171
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,680
<i>I'm not... I'm not... I'm not...</i>

172
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,310
<i>Awesome!</i>

173
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,730
Um, Mr. Takasaki?

174
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,400
Sorry for asking such
a personal question.

175

<i>That turned out well.</i>

176
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,370
Ms. Sakurai, work
hard in your first class.

177
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,290
You, too, Mr. Takasaki.

178
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,620
I will!

179
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,500
Well, please excuse me.

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,960
<i>You, too, Mr. Takasaki...</i>

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,550
<i>You, too, Mr. Takasaki...
You, too, Mr. Takasaki...</i>

182
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,600
That's the spirit.

183
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,230
P-please give me back my scythe!

184
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,900
If I don't pawn off this scythe
and buy some food, I'll die!

185
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,320
Oh, no, a river!

186
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,830
I did it.

187
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,660
Give it back!

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,500
First comes rock,
then comes paper...

189
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,210
You can't throw all of them,

190
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,670
Rock, paper, scissors!

191
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,800
I won!

192
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,730
Thanks.

193
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,350
That's not all.

194
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,440
...with nata de coco.

195
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Tomorrow's weather is...

196
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,610
Miracle Pinch! But,
I'm just getting started!

197
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,090
Imagination

198
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,550
Do you want me to guess what
Imagination

199
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,300
Do you want me to guess what

200
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,680
you aren't thinking
about at all, right now?

201
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,180
What is it?

202
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,440
Carefree Office Lady Travel Diary.

203
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,940
Just a little.

204
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,610
Running onto trains is dangerous.

205
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,610
Mio, Mai, the train's here! Hurry!

206
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,110
Wa... wait...

207
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,160
All right! I made it! Safe!

208
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
You got on by yourself.

209
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,130
<i>Selamat tinggal...</i>

210
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,590
What will you have?

211
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,720
Give me your orders.
What will you have?

212
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,050
Give me your orders.

213
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,090
One albacore.

214
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,510
Yellowtail and salmon roe.

215
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,350
Give me your orders.

216
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,810
Tuna and flounder fin, please.

217
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,970
One urchin.

218
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,810
Um, one albacore and, uh...

219
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,070
I forgot.

220
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,690

Everyday Life
Part 29

222
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,310
Oh, hello.

223
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,730
H-hello. Um, can I help you?

224
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,730
Well...

225
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,490
W-wait! What are you doing?

226
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,120
Well, I just thought
you seemed unusual.

227
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,580
There's nothing unusual
about me. I'm perfectly normal.

228
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,250
This key is an accessory.

229
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,920
Hey, how did you do
this? Come on, tell me.

230
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,220
Please give that back! Give it back!

231
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,930
Okay, let's do this.

232
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,730
See ya.

233
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,640
Why?

234
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,610
Sorry, sorry. I'm just kidding.

235
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm serious. Give it back.

236
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,320
Which hand?

237
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,660
It's in your bag!

238
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,910
Wow, correct!

239
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,080
Second question!

240
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,290
What?

241
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,960
Kenta's mom bought ten apples.

242
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,670
His mom ate three of them.

243
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,960
She gave four of the remaining
apples to their neighbor, Yumiko.

244
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,720
Where is your arm?

245
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,670
In your bag!

246
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,260
Amazing! Correct again!

247
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,140
Now give it back.

248
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,520
Last question!

249
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,890
If you get this question
right, you'll receive an arm!

250
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,400
What? It was mine to begin with!

251
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
You don't want an arm?

252
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,020
I want it!

253
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,610
Here's the challenge.
Say the word "bag" ten times.

254
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,450
Bag... bag... bag...

255
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,330
Bag... bag... bag... bag.

256
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,660
What do you usually draw on?

257
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,290
A drawing ba... I mean, board.

258
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,210
Wrong!

259
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,460
What?

260
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,840
The answer we were
looking for was "paper".

261
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,630
That's not fair.

262
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,470
I'm kidding.

263
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,600
Please stop following me.

264
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,020
Fine, fine. Sorry.

265
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,690
It came off.

266
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:53,050
<i>It came off!</i>

267
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,110
Mio.

268
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,320
Let's go home.

269
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,860
Huh? Are you on your
way home from school?

270
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,240
I just ran into someone interesting.

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,490
What sort of person?

272
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,160
Her arm came off.

273
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,830
What?

274
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,200
She had a key on her back.

275
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,700
What are you talking about?

276
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,710
I met someone like that.

277
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,920
That's weird...

278
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,630
Short Thoughts

279
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,470
I want to use some quotation marks
that have a pretty rad vibe to them.

280
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,190
Nano, let's go.

282
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,980

Everday Life

283
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,100
Okay.

284
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,740
Well, they're just kids, after all.

285
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,200
I won!

286
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,450
I lost.

287
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,370
What are they doing?

288
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,990
They're doing it all wrong.

289
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,910
Sakamoto, how many
points was that?

290
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,790
What?

291
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,080
Ready, Professor?

292
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,790
Ready.

293
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,750
She didn't throw the ball yet!

294
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,260
Is she trying to kill me?

295
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,850
Mr. Sakamoto, how
many points was that?

296
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,980
You, too?

297
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,100
She swung again!

298
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,650
You're next, Sakamoto.

299
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,980
Why me?

300
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,650
How do you expect me to
hold a bat with these paws?

301
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,530
What?

302
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,530
Geez, what do you think
my paws are, anyway?

303
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,080
You're always poking
the pads on my feet.

304
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,620
This is why you kids are...

305
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,310
Well, you know,

306
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,970
it's not safe for you
to play on your own...

307
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,520
So I'm keeping an eye on you.

308
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,560
I have no intention
of participating.

309
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,150
Why don't you start
with some catch?

310
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,690
Okay.

311
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,480
Okay, coach!

312
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,360
Coach?

313
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,280
Coach! We only have one glove.

314
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,990
You'll be fine without one.

315
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,700
Coach, the glove doesn't fit.

316
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,530
Weren't you just wearing
it on your left hand?

317
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,160
Coach!

318
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
You girls are hopeless.

319
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Professor, ready?

320
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,750
Ready.

321
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,140
Where did it go?

322
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,480
So the teacher got mad at me.

323
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,640
No surprise there.

324
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,650
I agree.

325
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,900
You too, Mai?

326
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,730
But she didn't need to go that far.

327
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,990
That's true, but you should
be careful from now on.

328
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,370
That's right. You never
know what will happen.

329
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,870
Ah, excuse me.

330
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,800
<i>Oh! Gentleman!</i>

331
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,710
Listen to this.

332
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,550
Mai, let me borrow it again.

333
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,260
Okay.

334
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,970
Oh, great! Everyone should
have such good friends.

335
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,180
<i>Maybe she's the girl my sister mentioned.
Oh, great! Everyone should
have such good friends.</i>

336
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,970
Oh, great! Everyone should
have such good friends.

Birthday Present

338
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,890
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

339
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,980
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

340
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,320
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

341
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,120
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

342
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:36,960
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

343
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

344
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,260
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

345
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:59,190
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

346
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,110
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

347
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,410
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

348
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:24,420
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

349
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,720
I am a wooden cube.

350
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,300
Become my owner, and you
shall inherit an ancient weapon.
