It's me-ow!

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,240
Somehow

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
while having an awkward conversation
Itsumo to chigau kimi to

Nah, it's one-sided

Oops, our glances met
Yabai! Shisen acchatta!!!

What's up with this excitement?
Nani nani!? kono dokidoki!?

My train of thought slips into chaos
Shikoukairo gucchagucha konsen...

This is the first time it has happened to me,
Konna koto hajimete da yo

44
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,730
maybe I have a fever?
Netsu demo aru no kanaa

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,490
My love took a sudden turn
Kyuutenchokka irasshatta koigokoro

46
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,110
And I instantly blushed a deep red
Acchuuma kao hakka de makkakka

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,870
N-n-no way! My hands are trembling
Ba.ba...baka na!? Te ga furueru zo

48
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,490
Is this what's commonly referred to as "love"?
Kore ga zoku ni iu "koi" na no!?

49
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,200
I st-st-stuttered through our conversation

I feel like I can fly in the sky

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,560
O-o-one-one-sided love

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,820
Why is the Earth round?

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,660
Why do rockets fly?

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,910
Why do magnets attract each other?

63
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,410
All of the world's truths can
be found through science!

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,750

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,380
ghosts, and paranormal activity...

67
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,670
Such things cannot possibly exist!

68
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,550
They mustn't exist...

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,520
I don't believe in psychic mediums!

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,980
I have a question.

What is your blood type, Soap?

I just explained this to you!

When you win, you're
supposed to hit me!

Amazingly cruel, that is!

00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,540
Not yet! Why did you hit me?!

134
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,540

Geez, Mai!

You can't do that. You
can't throw all of them.

house while I'm gone.

183
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,580
Okay!

184
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,550
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 21

185
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,720
Why does Nano's dharma
only have one eye?

186
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,640
I know!

187
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,390
If I make an eye for it,
maybe she'll praise me.

188
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,400
Maybe she'll say I
can eat lots of snacks.

189
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,130
I might have made a mistake...

190
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,920
What am I going to do?

191
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,590
Maybe she'll get mad at me.

192
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,970
You can't have any
snacks until I say so!

193
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,930
Um, like this... and this...

194
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,400
What are you doing?

195
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,860
Oh, Sakamoto.
What should I do?

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,400
What is this?

197
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,280
What are you doing?

198
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,740
Doesn't this belong to that girl?

199
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,580
But it was missing an eye...

200
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,420
You're hopeless.
Do as I tell you.

201
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,310
I'm home!

202
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,270
Good luck.

203
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,690
Sakamoto!

204
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,400
Are you going out, Mr. Sakamoto?

205
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,900
Professor, I'm home.

206
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,910
Sorry I'm late. I was choosing
a new book to borrow.

207
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,870
What are you doing?

208
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,290
Professor! What's wrong
with your stomach?

209
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,750
Don't laugh!

210
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,170
I'm giving birth.

211
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
No, no, no. That's not possible!

212
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,090
I'm giving birth!

213
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,260
The baby's coming!
The baby is coming!

214
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,390
Uh, is this some kind of game?
The baby's coming!
The baby is coming!

215
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,100
No! I'm giving birth to
your younger brother!

216
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,710
It's your brother.

217
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,750
She's done for!

218
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,300
Table
Turning

219
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,010
Mio, Mio.

220
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,970
What?

221
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,850
Let's do some table-turning.

222
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,430
What's that?

223
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,060
You mean you don't know?

224
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
I don't.

225
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,980
I'll try to explain it to you.

226
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,360
You start by drawing a shrine gate in the middle of a piece of paper.

227
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Then you write "yes", "no", and the Japanese alphabet all around it.

228
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,780
Okay.

229
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,950
In some places, you're supposed to draw a fried bean curd...

230
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,330
But for now,
let's keep it simple.

231
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,370
Okay.

232
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,210
Then you open the north
window, so spirits can come in.

233
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,210
Okay.

234
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,840
Then you put a 10 yen
coin on the shrine gate...

235
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,220
We both put our fingers on top of
it together, and we ask questions...

236
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,770
about secrets, about love,
or about our worries.

237
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,350
Okay.

238
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,520
Even though we don't do
anything, the coin will move.

239
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,610
And the spirits will
answer our questions.

240
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,650
Pretty amazing, right?

241
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,570
But some things are taboo.

242
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,740
You can't do it alone, and
you have to take it seriously.

243
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,160
Or else you'll be haunted by spirits...

244
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,790
And if you stop in the middle,
you'll be haunted too, so be careful.

245
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,170
I see...

246
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,630
It's kind of a dangerous game.

247
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,670
Let's give it a try.

248
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,630
I'll pass.

249
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>What?</i>

250
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:05,730
Nichijou: Everyday Life Part 22

251
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,610
And with that, we'll stop here.

252
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,410
We'll have a small quiz
tomorrow, so be sure to study.

253
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,450
What? Push it back.

254
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,620
No matter how far
we push it back,

255
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,120
your grade'll still be the same.

256
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,790
Maybe.

257
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,460
Ms. Sakurai!

258
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,210
Aioi, what is it?

259
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,670
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

260
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,380
Yes?

261
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,090
It's about our last quiz.

262
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,890
What is this?

263
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,390
That would be "fly".

264
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,390
Oh no, I wasn't
asking for the answer.

265
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,980
Did you draw this thing that looks
like it'd be killed by a Poof spell?

266
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,570
Oh, yes. I thought drawings
might make the quiz easier...

267
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,740
You draw some cool pictures!

268
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,030
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,530
Since I'm not very good at drawing,

270
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,490
it must have been hard
to tell what they were...

271
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,830
I see.

272
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,080
Oh, right!

273
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,250
Will you put my
drawing on the next quiz?

274
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,630
I'll draw something really cool.

275
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,040
Okay.

276
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,380
Mio!

277
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,880
Listen to this...

278
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,920
My drawing's going
to be on the next quiz.

279
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,260
What? Why?

280
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,300
The teacher's going to put it on.

281
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,010
If you start drawing now,

282
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,060
you'll definitely get
your drawing in there, too.

283
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,310
I'm not so sure about that...

284
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,770
You're not going to draw?

285
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,730
No, I'm fine. I'll pass.

286
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,480
Besides, I have to return this.

287
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,440
Really?

288
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm going to draw a cool guy!

289
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,250
Not bad.

290
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,920
He's so cool!

291
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,840
Aioi, you're great at drawing,
aren't you? I'm impressed.

292
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,180
I'm not great... I'm awesome.

293
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,260
Just kidding.

294
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
By the way, his name
is Samidare George.

295
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,020
Oh, that's even cooler!

296
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,190
<i>Cool?</i>

297
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,990
Hold on, you two.
Cool is usually more...

298
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,990
... like this, right?

299
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,790
Amazing! This looks
just like a manga!

300
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,750
Naganohara, do you draw manga?

301
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,920
Well, just a little...

302
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,800
Amazing. You'll have
to show me sometime.

303
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,760
I don't know about that...

304
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,300
You won't? I'd really like to see it.

305
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,510
Please show me.

306
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,220
What? Ah, well...

307
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,060
Give me that!

308
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
My drawing's way cooler!

309
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,400
You copied me!

310
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,900
No, I didn't.

311
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,530
You copied me!

312
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,700
It's a type of copying
known as an homage!

313
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,240
You admitted it!

314
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,120
It's so cool...

315
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,080
Anything goes?!

316
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,130
What about this?

317
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,090
Glasses!

318
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,640
Intelligence and a cool look
appeal to women of all ages!

319
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,810
Oh... glasses...

320
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,060
Does he have poor eyesight?

321
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,400
He should wear contacts.

322
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,320
<i>They don't understand!</i>

323
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,360
Mine looks something like this.

324
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,240
<i>They're under his ears!</i>

325
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,120
You copied me again!

326
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,910
They're sunglasses.

327
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,660
He's so cool!

328
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,540
You're okay with that?!

329
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,830
Then, how about this?

330
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,170
The butler!

331
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,000
From picking you up
to serving you tea,

332
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,420
he makes you feel like a young lady!

333
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,340
Taste the magic of Darjeeling!

334
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,590
Glasses again?

335
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm sorry, but I don't understand...

336
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,180
You didn't hear what
I said about the contacts.

337
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,850
Mio, you don't understand.

338
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,230
I'll show you the
true meaning of cool...

339
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,150
It's this.

340
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,570
<i>It's floating!</i>

341
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,240
<i>Wait! Is this thing moving?</i>

342
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
He looks so fast and cool.

343
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,660
<i>You're joking!</i>

344
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,750
<i>Cool is...</i>

345
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,130
Coolness is...

346
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:44,130
Coolness is...
coolness is something...

347
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,300
<i>True coolness is...</i>

348
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,810
This is cool!

349
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,280
<i>Oh, shooooooooooot...</i>

350
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,530
Just kidding!

Short Thoughts
Short Thoughts

353
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,650
I drew this while listening to jazz.

The Next Day

355
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,360
Morning!

356
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Master, good morning.

357
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,490
Who are you calling master?!

358
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,870
I'm handing out
this morning's quiz,

359
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,120
so please pass them down.

360
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,250
<i>I'm done for...</i>

361
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,710
<i>I wanted to keep
my drawings a secret.</i>

362
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,960
<i>I can't believe
I drew that picture.</i>

363
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:10,760
<i>But even though I lost control,
it could have been worse.</i>

364
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,560
<i>I should count myself lucky.</i>

365
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,020
<i>But I'm sure Yukko will
tease me for two or three days...</i>

366
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,520
<i>No, no! I must let
go and look forward.</i>

367
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,360
Master Mio, hurry.

368
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,700
Umm...

369
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Begin.

370
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,160
Master Mio...

371
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,060
I wake up in the morning, brush my
teeth, and before I know it it's 10 PM
Asa okite ha wo migaite atto yuuma gogo juuji

372
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:01,100
We laughed and had a lot of fun today
Kyou mo takusan waratta na takusan tokimeita na

373
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:07,400
and at times I and my friends chatted noisily like nitwits
Tomodachi to baka mitai ni sawaideru toki ni mo

374
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,240
When our eyes met, flutteringly, it was coincidence
Chirachira tte me ga au guuzen da yo ne

375
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,080
It's not in me to say this is my first love
Hatsukoi da tte ienai kyara ja nainda mon

376
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,130
Hey, we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
Nee ashita mo aeru yo ne

377
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,430
If I close my eyes, all I see is a sparkling you
Mabuta wo tojiru to kirakira kimi darake

378
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:42,310
I wonder why today was so much fun again
Kyou mo tanoshikatta ne aa doushite kana

379
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:51,280
I'm so happy, happy, that my love awakened
Ureshii na ureshii na hajimemashita koigokoro

380
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,580
I'll see you again tomorrow, so good night
Ashita mata aeru ne oyasuminasai

381
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:07,590
I'll see you in my dreams soon, so good night
Yume de sugu aeru ne oyasuminasai

382
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,220
Zing! Boom! Bang!

383
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,510
Nice to meet you.
I'm onomatopoeia.

384
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,640
You can't help but say "cock-a-doodle-doo", even though that isn't Japanese.

385
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,520
Narration:    Koyama Rikiya

386
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,230
The next episode of <i>Nichijou</i> is episode 6.

387
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,520
Don't miss it.
