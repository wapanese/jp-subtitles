00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,490
After the Final, let's end this.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,660
Huh?

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,660
You've done more than enough for me, Victor.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,360
Thanks to you, I was able to give 
everything I had to my last season.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,920
Thank you for everything, Victor.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,420
Thank you for being my coach.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,470
Victor?

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,430
Damn...

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,060
I didn't expect Katsuki Yuri to be 
such a selfish human being.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,400
Right.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,440
I made this selfish decision on my own.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,700
I'm retiring.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,210
What are you doing, Yuri?

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,890
Oh, I'm just surprised to see you cry.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,850
I'm mad, okay?

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,670
You're the one who said it was 
only until the Grand Prix Final!

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,660
I thought you needed my help more.

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,670
Aren't you going to make a comeback?

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,550
You don't have to worry about me—

20
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,560
How can you tell me to return to 
the ice while saying you're retiring?!

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,550
<i>We decided to each make our own 
decisions after the free skate.</i>

Katsuki Yuri, Japan's ace, hopes to turn his

Phichit Chulanont, the first Thai skater 
to qualify for the Final, is in fifth.

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,340
And Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada enters 
the free skate, shockingly, in sixth.

Now to you, Mr. Morooka at the rink.

47
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,770
Yes, Morooka here.

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,260
Skater Katsuki has not practiced publicly

49
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,210
since the day after the short program.

50
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,440
He's worried his supporters 
by remaining out of sight,

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,170
but he returned to the ice for 
the morning's public practice.

52
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,670
Hi, Victor!

53
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,970
Hi, Stéphane. It's been a while.

54
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,570
People of Japan, please continue 
to cheer for Yuri today.

Hmm... It seems neither Yuri Katsuki

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,350
nor Victor Nikiforov have the

The Men's Singles Free Skate is about to start.

64
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,410
First on the ice is 
Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada.

65
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,780
A string of short program mishaps has 
cost him points, and he's far behind.

66
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,620
JJ!

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,640
You can do this!

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,350
JJ, the music's started!

69
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,560
<i>I can't believe I just did that.</i>

70
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,440
<i>It's been sixteen years since I started skating.</i>

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,940
Mom! Dad! Look!

72
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,950
<i>I feel like I've been tossed onto the 
ice naked for the very first time.</i>

73
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,790
Looks like he didn't go into 
the jump with enough speed.

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,750
That jump is Jean-Jacques Leroy's specialty,

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,820
but his practice was mired in mistakes, too.

76
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,630
Still, he's the sole skater among the 
final six with four quads in his programs.

77
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,560
Quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop.

78
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,760
Yeah!

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
He did it!

80
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,600
Leave me alone!

81
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,890
JJ?

82
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,340
Sorry... Mom, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't know what to do!

84
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,850
<i>I'd never been that angry before.</i>

85
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,900
<i>I'm truly a bird with a broken wing.</i>

86
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,110
<i>Stop it.</i>

87
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,840
<i>I don't deserve applause right now!</i>

88
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,400
<i>Given the current totals,</i>

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,450
<i>I might be able to claw my way onto 
the podium if the others mess up.</i>

90
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,270
<i>But still...</i>

91
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,480
<i>Me? Win out of sheer luck?</i>

92
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,880
<i>That's not like me at all!</i>

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,090
A triple axel.

94
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,250
Another success!

95
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,680
We'll greet him with a smile, 
no matter what score he gets.

96
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,180
The "JJ Style" I have in mind is...

97
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,190
Coach, I—

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,890
First of all, say, "Yes."

99
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,890
<i>This is so that JJ can stay JJ.</i>

100
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,940
<i>Watch me!</i>

101
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,780
For his final jump, he's planned 
a quadruple toe loop.

102
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,950
<i>A plan is just a plan!</i>

103
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,240
A quadruple loop.

104
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,680
Jean-Jacques Leroy!

105
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,240
<i>Yes!</i>

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,540
He rose to the challenge!

107
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,250
There was a step-out, but overall, a great jump.

108
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,070
Huh?

109
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,040
I guess he did do that jump during practice.

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,300
JJ landed a quadruple loop?

111
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,800
The Four Continents will be fun.

112
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,850
<i>Their battles will continue for years 
after this Grand Prix Final.</i>

113
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,490
<i>No tale is more compelling 
than one that never ends.</i>

114
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,520
Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada's score is 
213.91! A high score right off the bat!

115
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,520
It's JJ Style!

116
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,890
JJ hasn't changed at all.

117
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,570
A pupil's accomplishment 
is headier than any wine.

118
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,080
Phichit, use your performance 
to intoxicate the world.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,380
In his short program,

120
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,640
Phichit Chulanont of Thailand, age 20, 
bewitched the audience here in Spain.

121
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,380
His supporters back home have 
high expectations, as well.

122
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,570
<i>I've never had such a big crowd 
cheering for me before.</i>

123
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,970
<i>I really want to turn in a 
flawless performance!</i>

124
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,750
A triple axel...

125
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,120
He stumbled, but got up right away.

126
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,060
<i>I have to entertain the audience!</i>

127
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,330
Jiayou!

128
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,300
<i>Right now, the toe loop is my only quad.</i>

129
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,430
<i>I can't easily add more to my 
quad repertoire just yet, but...</i>

130
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,920
A quadruple toe loop.

131
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,250
Bravo!

132
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,850
His nerves settled, and he nailed it!

133
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,070
Okay!

134
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,080
<i>Here at the Grand Prix Final,</i>

135
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,970
<i>I'm confident that I stand out 
as a skater unlike any other!</i>

136
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,960
Triple flip, single loop, double flip.

137
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,460
He landed his last jump combination!

138
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,260
<i>I have a dream.</i>

139
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,330
<i>I haven't told Yuri about it yet...</i>

140
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,010
<i>But I want to have an ice show 
in Thailand someday.</i>

141
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,310
<i>I want everyone in Thailand to know 
how fun figure skating is!</i>

142
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,910
Please be my coach until I retire!

143
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,200
I wish you'd never retire.

144
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,250
Let's win gold together at 
the Grand Prix Final.

145
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,910
Don't worry. You can win gold, Yuri.

146
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,740
Believe in yourself.

147
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,920
Hey, Victor...

148
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,420
I told you before that I wanted you 
to stay who you were, right?

149
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,170
Don't suddenly start trying 
to sound like a coach now.

150
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,850
I want to smile for my last time on the ice.

151
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,460
Yuri, listen to me.

152
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,190
I debated whether I should 
tell you this now, but...

153
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,690
I took a break after becoming the 
five-time world champion to coach you,

154
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,950
so how is it possible that you still 
haven't won a single gold medal?

155
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,460
How much longer are you 
going to stay in warm-up mode?

156
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,210
I really want to kiss the gold medal.

157
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,020
What's going on?

158
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,840
Skater Katsuki looks like he might be crying.

159
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,060
<i>I've already made up my mind about my goal.</i>

160
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,440
Go!

161
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,630
Go, Yuri!

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,390
Hey, he's running out of time.

163
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,850
<i>My name is Katsuki Yuri.</i>

164
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,170
<i>I'm a dime-a-dozen Japanese figure skater.</i>

165
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,260
<i>I'm 24.</i>

166
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,490
He said he'd like to use this program to express 
the different forms of love he feels.

167
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,750
His music for the free skate is "Yuri on Ice."

168
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,730
There will be two consecutive quads.

169
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,220
The first is part of a combination...

170
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,770
Quadruple toe loop, double toe loop.

171
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,180
<i>For more than half of my life, 
I've been trying to catch up to Victor.</i>

172
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,270
<i>Thank you for bringing me 
all the way here, Victor.</i>

173
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,280
<i>And it's not just Victor I have to thank.</i>

174
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,380
A quadruple Salchow.

175
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,360
He's changed since Yurio taught 
him how to do the Salchow.

176
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,210
A triple flip.

177
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,210
<i>He changed it from the triple loop...</i>

178
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,980
<i>Yuri, you can't be serious.</i>

179
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,150
<i>My performance needs to be better 
than flawless for a chance at the gold.</i>

180
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,840
<i>I've been thinking ever since 
the short program that</i>

181
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,260
<i>I'd like the final free skate of my career</i>

182
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,300
<i>to have the same difficulty as Victor's.</i>

183
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,280
A triple axel.

184
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,200
A triple flip is planned next.

185
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,850
A quadruple toe loop?

186
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,710
<i>A quad?</i>

187
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,140
<i>You added another for a 
total of four quads, Yuri?</i>

188
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,130
<i>Do you realize it now, Victor?</i>

189
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,800
Triple axel, single loop, triple Salchow.

190
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,310
<i>I don't want it to end here, Victor.</i>

191
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,430
<i>I want to be in figure skating with you forever.</i>

192
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,310
Triple Lutz, triple toe loop.

193
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,490
<i>But your staying on as my coach</i>

194
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,360
<i>means slowly killing you 
as a competitive skater.</i>

195
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,780
<i>Look at the Victor who lives on inside me.</i>

196
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,190
<i>Your becoming my coach 
wasn't a waste of time.</i>

197
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>I'm the only one in the whole 
world who can prove that.</i>

198
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,720
The last jump is a quad, the signature 
move of his coach, Victor Nikiforov!

199
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,960
A quadruple flip.

200
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,010
He did it!

201
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,160
Katsuki Yuri has succeeded in creating a 
masterful culmination of his career!

202
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,450
Yuri!

203
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,180
<i>I don't want to go to the kiss and cry.</i>

204
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,680
<i>Because going back there means it's over.</i>

205
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,430
Don't worry.

206
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,510
Your performance was so perfect, 
I'm sure you'll get a great score.

207
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,690
We have Katsuki Yuri's scores...

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,450
His free skate score is 221.58!

209
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,200
He's broken Victor Nikiforov's 
long-time world record

210
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,630
for the Men's Singles Free Skate!

211
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,250
His total score is 319.41!

212
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,500
He's jumped all the way to first place!

213
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,150
Congratulations, Yuri.

214
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,140
Having both Yuris beat my records

215
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,890
is the ultimate bliss as your 
choreographer and coach,

216
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,640
but it's the ultimate diss as a competitor.

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,370
Huh?

218
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,770
Does that mean you'll come back?

219
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,580
<i>That guy rumored to be retiring 
banged out a world record.</i>

220
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,110
<i>Talk about a dreamer.</i>

221
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,580
Christophe Giacometti is skating 
to "Rapsodie Espagnole."

222
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:44,570
<i>I thought this Grand Prix Final would 
be my last chance to win,</i>

223
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,510
<i>but Yuri easily beat my personal best.</i>

224
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,530
<i>Looks like it won't be that easy 
to get my hands on a medal,</i>

225
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,060
<i>but I think I'll be able to enjoy this 
year's Final until the very end.</i>

226
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,260
A quadruple Lutz.

227
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,640
He landed it again in the free skate!

228
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,640
<i>I can do this.</i>

229
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,210
Yeah!

230
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,890
Oh, please take our picture with this phone!

231
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,240
What was meant to be a quadruple 
Salchow became a single.

232
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,990
Hang in there, Chris!

233
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,020
Allez!

234
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,990
Chris!

235
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,600
<i>Victor...</i>

236
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,750
<i>I got too used to having you in front of me.</i>

237
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,190
<i>I pretended not to notice the discomfort 
of being surpassed by another.</i>

238
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,510
<i>But I can always fan the 
flames of regret within me!</i>

239
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,520
<i>There!</i>

240
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,340
A triple axel!

241
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,880
A lone triple axel?

242
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,390
He changed his program to make a jump 
into a combination in the second half.

243
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,850
Triple axel, single loop, triple Salchow.

244
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,070
His final jumps were successful!

245
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,260
Yes, he brought a combination 
he usually does in the first half

246
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,780
into the second instead.

247
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,600
We have a standing ovation from the audience!

248
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,550
Just look at their enthusiasm!

249
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,710
Chris!

250
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,710
Merci.

251
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,210
OMG!

252
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,190
His free skate score is 188.32.

253
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,480
His total score is 290.69.

254
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,700
After four skaters, he is currently in third.

255
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
At this time, Katsuki Yuri, currently in first,

256
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,510
is guaranteed a spot on the podium!

257
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,510
Congratulations!

258
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,730
Oh, thank you.

259
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,950
After the short program, he's 6.18 points 
behind the leader, Yuri Plisetsky.

260
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,110
Otabek! Davai!

261
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,610
He's now on the ice, gunning for a spot on 
the podium at his first Grand Prix Final.

262
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,610
Keep an eye out for the quadruple 
Salchow straight out of JJ's book!

263
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,110
Go, Otabek!

264
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,630
He is skating to the second movement 
from Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9."

265
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,270
<i>Now is the time for you to take center stage.</i>

266
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,450
<i>The whole world is waiting for you.</i>

267
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,760
A quadruple toe loop.

268
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,820
He did it!

269
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,860
Yakov...

270
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,130
I want to talk to you about something.

271
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,120
Right now?

272
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,140
Tell me later.

273
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,640
It's almost Yuri's turn!

274
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,560
Quadruple Salchow, triple toe loop.

275
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,470
What?!

276
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,630
You're coming back?!

277
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,060
Yeah.

278
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,560
For now, I'll time my return 
to the Russian Nationals.

279
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,310
Hey, does that mean the
pork cutlet bowl's retiring?

280
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,930
That's his decision.

281
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,070
He said he'd decide after the 
Grand Prix Final was over.

282
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,580
<i>Don't forget what it is you want.</i>

283
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,250
<i>Now is the time to take off.</i>

284
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,710
A triple axel.

285
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,550
<i>Fulfill your dream.</i>

286
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,450
<i>Only you can make it a reality.</i>

287
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,550
<i>Live your life.</i>

288
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,530
Victor?

289
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,250
<i>Dance your dream.</i>

290
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,690
<i>Sing, sing... Sing your own song.</i>

291
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,020
A quadruple Salchow.

292
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,660
He's landed all his quads!

293
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,870
Triple flip, single loop, triple Salchow.

294
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,530
Wow.

295
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,500
Originality isn't only about 
what you're born with.

296
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,880
At age 19, Otabek is about to prove that.

297
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,790
<i>Do to the fullest, play to 
the fullest, and discover.</i>

298
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,030
<i>Find your path, and go above and beyond it!</i>

299
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,140
<i>Now is your beginning.</i>

300
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,350
<i>Live your own life.</i>

301
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,350
Here comes the final jump...

302
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,140
A triple loop.

303
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,770
All of his jumps were successful!

304
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,560
<i>Now is your beginning. This is your time.</i>

305
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,090
Otabek Altin missed Jean-Jacques Leroy 
by a sliver and is currently in third!

306
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,090
Katsuki Yuri remains in first place.

307
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,760
The final skater to take the ice is 
the Russian fifteen-year-old,

308
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,710
Yuri Plisetsky.

309
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,820
Yuri, davai!

310
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,180
Yuri, davai!

311
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,020
<i>Yakov, Lilia.</i>

312
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,020
<i>Grandpa.</i>

313
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,020
YU             RI             O

314
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,350
Yurio-kun, davai!

315
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
<i>Yuko and the rest.</i>

316
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,020
Davai, davai!

317
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,030
<i>And Katsuki Yuri... Watch this closely.</i>

318
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,450
He is skating to "Allegro 
Appassionato in B Minor."

319
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,270
Yuri Plisetsky hammered out a new 
world record with his short program.

320
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,060
If he wins the Grand Prix Final 
in his senior debut,

321
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,380
that will make men's singles history.

322
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,420
First up is a quad!

323
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,400
A quadruple Salchow.

324
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,410
Success!

325
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,050
A spiral... into a triple axel.

326
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,070
Another success!

327
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,570
That was a difficult entry, and he 
used a raised arm with the jump,

328
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,440
earning higher marks for greater difficulty.

329
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,440
<i>Yuri Katsuki...</i>

330
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,580
<i>He screws up his jumps, but his step 
sequence grabs your attention.</i>

331
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
<i>I want to see him skate with no mistakes.</i>

332
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,530
<i>What kind of guy is he?</i>

333
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,630
<i>What a loser! He's crying!</i>

334
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,460
We don't need two Yuris in the same bracket.

335
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,080
Just retire already.

336
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,050
Moron!

337
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,170
<i>What, you're gonna retire once you win gold?</i>

338
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,380
<i>You don't care anymore now that you 
got a higher score than Victor's?</i>

339
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,510
<i>That's bull!</i>

340
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,020
<i>Don't disappoint me!</i>

341
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,560
<i>There are no gold medals 
for pigs to feed on!</i>

342
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,980
A triple flip.

343
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,030
<i>Hang in there, Yurio.</i>

344
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,490
<i>Here come the second-half jumps.</i>

345
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,490
<i>I'm going to win!</i>

346
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,470
A quadruple toe loop.

347
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,030
A big fall there!

348
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,590
He got up right away.

349
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,480
Beautiful spiral position.

350
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,500
<i>Yuratchka, look how strong you've become.</i>

351
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,710
<i>You've distanced yourself from 
being a prima ballerina,</i>

352
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,470
<i>but you've evolved into your own 
new beauty, Yuri Plisetsky.</i>

353
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,260
Quadruple Salchow, triple toe loop.

354
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,040
Brilliant execution!

355
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,390
What determination, raising both arms again!

356
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,480
<i>Are you watching, Katsuki Yuri?</i>

357
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,980
<i>I'm gonna beat your record someday.</i>

358
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,070
Quadruple toe loop, double toe loop.

359
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,300
He's added a quad at this point in the program!

360
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,200
<i>If you retire now, I'll make you regret 
it for the rest of your life.</i>

361
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,950
<i>Moron!</i>

362
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,450
Triple axel, single loop, triple Salchow.

363
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,370
He did it!

364
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,060
Yuri Plisetsky's free skate score is 200.97!

365
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,690
His total score narrowly beats Katsuki's

366
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,700
by 0.12 points to win the gold!

367
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,410
Well, Katsuki Yuri's on the 
podium for the first time!

368
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:34,710
Plisetsky: Gold, Katsuki: Silver, Leroy: Bronze
Astounding! New World Record Score

369
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:34,710
Guest: Stéphane Lambiel
Commentator: Morooka Hisashi

370
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,800
Yes, and what a magnificent result!

371
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,940
He showed us a performance that no one 
would have imagined after last year's Final.

372
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,350
It's not a gold medal, but...

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,350
I don't feel like kissing it unless it's gold.

374
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,860
Man, I really wanted to kiss Yuri's gold medal.

375
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm such a failure as a coach.

376
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,490
Yuri, do you have any suggestions?

377
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,490
Something that would excite me?

378
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,280
What did you think just now?

379
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,660
Oh, um... Well...

380
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,450
Victor!

381
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,580
Please stay with me in competitive 
figure skating for one more year!

382
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,840
This time, I'll win gold for sure!

383
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,090
Great!

384
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,700
But keep going!

385
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,590
What?

386
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,390
Even I'm worried about making a full comeback

387
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,560
if I'm also staying on as your coach.

388
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,400
In exchange, I'll need you to become a 
five-time world champion, at least.

389
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,720
Okay.

390
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,570
The men's singles silver medalist, 
Japan's Katsuki Yuri.

391
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:46,850
His exhibition is the free program of his coach, 
who's just announced his comeback,

392
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,030
last year's "Stay by Me."

393
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,040
<i>There's a place you just can't reach</i>

394
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,930
<i>unless you have a dream 
too large to bear alone.</i>

395
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,880
<i>We call everything on the ice "love."</i>

396
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,240
Yuri!
