Let's Send the Power of Sports Throughout Japan! 
Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional Figure Skating Championship

2
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,350
<i>Hello!</i>

3
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,770
<i>I'm Katsuki Yuri, one of the top figure 
skaters certified by the JSF.</i>

4
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,160
<i>My first competition this season is the 
Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional Championship</i>

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,180
<i>I hear I'm the oldest of the four skating 
in the senior men's single division.</i>

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,180
Age 17

7
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,180
Age 17

8
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,180
Age 18

9
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,180
Age 23

10
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,210
<i>Anything but the first spot!</i>

11
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,920
<i>Not the first spot!</i>

12
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,060
Skater Katsuki Yuri, you're up first.

13
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,670
<i>Not again...</i>

14
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,680
<i>I have the most horrible luck of the draw.</i>

15
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,190
Hey.

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,100
<i>It was the same in the last Nationals...</i>

17
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,030
<i>Hm?</i>

18
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,660
I got to see you draw the first spot 
in person again, Yuri-kun!

19
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,640
I love it!

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,810
Um...

21
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,390
What, you don't remember me?

22
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,220
What a shock!

23
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,220
Next up is skater Minami.

24
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,960
Right here! I'm Minami Kenjiro!

25
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,840
<i>Who's he again?</i>

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,230
Yay! I'm going fourth!

27
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,240
Fifth Skate 
Face Beet-Red!! It's the First Competition! 
The Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional Championship

28
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,850
Face Beet-Red!! It's the First Competition!

29
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,240
The Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu 
Regional Championship.

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,240
We've timed him to peak at the Grand 
Prix Final, so this isn't a problem.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,500
He can take it easy and earn 
a personal best score today!

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,580
I think I've told you this many times, but in 
last year's Nationals, I bombed everything.

33
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,610
They wondered if I was injured, 
but embarrassingly,

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,540
nothing was physically wrong with me.

35
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,500
I lost, despite being a top contender, 
because I was mentally weak.

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,510
Wow.

37
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,010
Okayama International Skate Rink

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,010
<i>I haven't been in a single competition 
since last year's Nationals.</i>

39
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,010
Maccachin's cheering for you, too!

40
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,620
<i>I've been practicing with Victor this whole time,</i>

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,620
Oh, yeah. Real cute.

42
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,770
Try to be happier.

43
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,850
<i>but to be honest, I'm still not sure about myself.</i>

44
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,820
<i>I have to figure out if I'm in good enough 
shape for the Grand Prix series.</i>

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,900
<i>The other skaters don't matter.</i>

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,870
Minami-kun, focus, okay? Focus!

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,870
<i>I feel someone staring at me...</i>

48
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,210
Remember how focused you 
were at the Nationals!

49
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,620
Don't get overwhelmed by 
the energy around you!

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,010
<i>Focus! Focus!</i>

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,630
Wow.

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,280
What a crowd.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,570
It's been like this since the 
public practice this morning.

54
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,930
Is Yuri okay?

55
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,110
He tends to get nervous before competitions.

56
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,330
Have you seen Victor?

57
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,140
The competition's about to start.

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,310
Sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,140
Why did you change clothes?

60
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,450
Today is my glorious debut as a coach, 
so I should be in formal dress.

61
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,900
You're exactly right...

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,650
That Russian coach stands out 
more than the skaters.

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,050
Ladies and gentlemen, this event 
is the senior men's short program.

64
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,610
As your coach, what should I say before 
sending you off to the program?

65
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,720
Will the competitors please 
take the ice for your warm-up?

66
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,420
What I'm thinking of right now is...

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,620
You have six minutes.

68
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,370
<i>My goal is to reach the Grand Prix Final.</i>

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,630
<i>I can't get nervous already at this stage.</i>

70
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,880
He's nervous...

71
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,360
Gentlemen, the warm-up has ended.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,100
Please leave the ice.

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,990
<i>Why is Victor getting all prickly?</i>

74
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,410
Yuri, turn around.

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,100
Huh?

76
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,380
Turn around, okay?

77
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,100
Um, like this?

78
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,950
Seduce me with all you have.

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,730
If your performance can charm me,

80
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,210
you can enthrall the entire audience.

81
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,540
That's what I always say in practice, right?

82
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,710
R-Right.

83
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,210
Good luck, Yuri!

84
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,210
Good luck!

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
<i>Remember...</i>

86
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,220
<i>Just skate like you do in practice.</i>

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,640
<i>I'm going to become a 
beautiful pork cutlet bowl!</i>

88
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,580
<i>Come on, guys! What's with 
this lukewarm response?</i>

89
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,460
<i>Back at Hot Springs on Ice, 
they were way more enthusiastic.</i>

90
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,800
<i>No, I bet Victor would like this step sequence.</i>

91
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,890
Yuri!

92
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,230
Try to imagine entangling more of the egg.

93
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,610
Think of the pork cutlet bowl!

94
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,350
Right!

95
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,940
Yuri, dance more like you're 
trying to seduce me.

96
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,440
<i>That's right.</i>

97
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,940
<i>I'm a pork cutlet bowl 
fatale that enthralls men.</i>

98
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,200
<i>First up is a spread eagle into a triple axel.</i>

99
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,240
<i>Great!</i>

100
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,330
<i>I'll continue the momentum 
with a quadruple Salchow!</i>

101
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,610
<i>Over-rotation!</i>

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,500
I was drawn to you because of...

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,420
The way you skate like your 
body is creating music.

104
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,380
<i>Great, Yuri!</i>

105
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,440
<i>It's perfect!</i>

106
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,100
<i>The last jump is a combination,
so it's worth the most points.</i>

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,470
<i>A quad into a triple—</i>

108
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,090
<i>Crap, it turned into a double.</i>

109
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,770
<i>This is the last element...</i>

110
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,620
<i>On to the conclusion for the love-crazed couple...</i>

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,200
<i>Er, so how did it go?</i>

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,870
<i>That's right, the woman casts 
aside the man she seduced</i>

113
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,910
<i>and leaves for the next man!</i>

114
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,280
That was so cool, Yuri-kun!

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,970
That was awesome!

116
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,540
<i>Who's that?</i>

117
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,290
<i>I managed to finish somehow.</i>

118
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,880
<i>I wonder if I did okay.</i>

119
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,380
<i>What does Victor think?</i>

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,460
The first half was great.

121
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,440
But you were too focused on jumps in the 
second, so your performance got sloppy.

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,720
Right.

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,200
I don't really like that kind of thing.

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,980
Right.

125
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,300
Why's he getting scolded?

126
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,520
He really got the audience fired up.

127
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,940
He may score a personal best...

128
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,150
The scores, please, for Katsuki Yuri-san.

129
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,290
His short program score: 94.36.

130
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,410
He is currently in first place.

131
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,410
He beat his previous best by almost ten points!

132
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,730
Amazing!

133
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,160
While this won't be an official record,

134
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,630
this would've been among the 
top ten scores in the world!

135
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,130
Hmm... Since you weren't under pressure,

136
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,170
I thought you'd score in the hundreds.

137
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,420
Right, you've scored above a hundred points
to break the world record multiple times.

138
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,810
Oh, right, Yuri.

139
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,300
About tomorrow's free skate...

140
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,560
Lower the difficulty of the jumps 
and focus on performance.

141
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,610
Huh?

142
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,100
You've never nailed them 
during practice, have you?

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,560
But...

144
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,300
It's not a bad idea to lower the 
difficulty early in the season, is it?

145
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,540
You should prioritize adjusting your 
programs to help you reach your peak

146
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,570
for the Grand Prix Final.

147
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,610
Representing Kure Higashi High School Skate Club, please welcome Fujiwara Hikaru-san.

148
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,450
Are you saying you can't listen to your coach?

149
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,200
That was amazing!

150
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,210
Yuri-kun's pure charms became a rich eros 
in the best form of betrayal possible!

151
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,100
Minami-kun, get ready.

152
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,670
It's almost time.

153
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,040
Kanako-sensei, you saw it, right?

154
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,300
You saw that triple axel?

155
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,870
For me, that was a GOE of 3,000,000 points!

156
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,470
Yeah, I hope you can land your Achilles 
heel, the triple axel, this time.

157
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,580
Yeah!

158
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm gonna show Yuri-kun my skating!

159
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,590
How do you feel looking ahead to the free skate?

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,710
This concludes the men's singles short program.

161
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,480
Huh?

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,710
Tomorrow's free skate—

163
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,100
Of course you'll see Yuri be perfect.

164
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,460
And I managed to land the triple axel, too!

165
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,630
That was your best performance yet!

166
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,110
Oh!

167
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,610
Did you see my "Lohengrin" performance?

168
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,740
I was being interviewed, so I didn't. Sorry.

169
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:42,080
I even had a similar costume made to the one 
from your famous "Lohengrin" program.

170
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,580
That's a costume from my dark past...

171
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,580
You don't have a dark past!

172
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,590
Don't make fun of me for looking up to you 
for so long and trying to catch up to you!

173
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,010
I'm gonna give tomorrow's free 
skate everything I've got!

174
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,090
Please give it all you've got, too, Yuri-kun!

175
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,340
I won't forgive you if you slack off!

176
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,310
Wow!

177
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,850
Skater Minami's issued a challenge!

178
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,800
At last year's Nationals, skater Minami Kenjiro 
finished ahead of skater Katsuki.

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,080
<i>He's the one whose total score was way higher
than mine because I self-destructed...</i>

180
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,740
His first senior division competition

181
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,920
will be a clash over a possible 
changing of the guard!

182
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,190
<i>Minami-kun!</i>

183
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,420
Here in Okayama, skater Katsuki will face him

184
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,420
<i>Crap...</i>

185
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,860
with the first public performance 
of his free skate program!

186
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,360
The Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional 
Figure Skating Championship's

187
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,870
men's singles free skate is about to begin.

188
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,730
All eyes are on skater Katsuki Yuri 
and his coach Victor Nikiforov.

189
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,350
Hi!

190
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,900
Katsuki ended yesterday's short program 
in first place by a large margin,

191
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,390
Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional Championship 
Okayama International Skate Rink (Okayama City)

192
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,020
scoring a personal best of 94.36.

193
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,390
In his free skate, he will attempt three quads.

194
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,310
<i>Victor and I decided to lower the difficulty 
and only do one quad, but...</i>

195
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,790
I'm gonna try a quad, too!

196
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,680
Seriously?

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,930
You've never landed one, not even in practice!

198
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,090
I'll try one, too!

199
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,400
Okay, I'll try, too.

200
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,260
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the 
senior men's singles free skate event.

201
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,410
Will the competitors please take 
the ice for your warm-up?

202
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,660
You have six minutes.

203
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,710
<i>No, no.</i>

204
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,980
<i>I have to focus on myself!</i>

205
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,240
Yuri...

206
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,630
How can someone who can't motivate 
others motivate himself?

207
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm disappointed in you.

208
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,300
<i>What about my own motivation 
that he just destroyed?</i>

209
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,660
Representing Hakata Skate Club, 
please welcome Minami Kenjiro-san.

210
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,850
Hey, are you listening to me?

211
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,140
You're nervous, aren't you, Minami-kun?

212
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,120
Good luck, Minami-kun!

213
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,630
You don't have a dark past!

214
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,630
Don't make fun of me for looking up to you 
for so long and trying to catch up to you!

215
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,390
Good luck, Minami-kun!

216
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,770
Good luck!

217
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,690
<i>Minami-kun's firing up the crowd right off!</i>

218
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,900
<i>I guess he's popular.</i>

219
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,480
<i>First, a triple axel.</i>

220
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,930
<i>Oh, he'll make the next one just fine!</i>

221
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,850
<i>Next up, a quadruple toe loop!</i>

222
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,190
<i>Wow.</i>

223
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,900
<i>Is he going to go on a roll?</i>

224
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,310
<i>Man, the way he's so inconsistent...</i>

225
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,120
<i>He reminds me of the skater I used to be.</i>

226
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,460
<i>I can't take my eyes off him.</i>

227
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,950
<i>He already has the necessary skill 
set to compete in figure skating.</i>

228
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,870
<i>I can tell by the cheers alone</i>

229
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,460
<i>that you're the star on the stage.</i>

230
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,010
The scores, please, for Minami Kenjiro-san.

231
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,020
His free skate program score: 152.14.

232
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,340
His total score: 214.97.

233
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,820
Yeah!

234
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,680
My personal best score!

235
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,680
He is currently in first place.

236
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,690
Representing Kure Higashi High School Skate Club, please welcome Fujiwara Hikaru-san.

237
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,690
Go!

238
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,410
Yeah!

239
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,040
Representing Okayama Fine Arts University 
High School, please welcome Omiki Yuto-san.

240
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,380
Okay, me too!

241
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,030
Go!

242
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,040
Good luck!

243
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,490
Great! If he keeps it up, it'll be 
a personal best for sure!

244
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,040
Yeah, this costume's great.

245
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,980
You look beautiful in it.

246
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,490
Your lips are chapped.

247
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,420
I heard he's only doing one quad at 
the beginning this time, but...

248
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,840
He hates making compromises, yeah.

249
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,600
Good luck, Yuri-kun!

250
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,330
Representing Ice Castle Hasetsu, 
please welcome Katsuki Yuri-san.

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,330
For this first public performance 
of his free program,

252
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,530
the music is an original composition 
expressing Katsuki's skating career,

253
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,460
titled "Yuri on Ice."

254
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,720
The program was choreographed 
by Victor Nikiforov.

255
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,830
<i>This program starts off with the Yuri from 
back when he felt he was fighting alone.</i>

256
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,080
<i>The first jump is a quad-triple combination.</i>

257
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,760
<i>He's been landing it just fine during practice.</i>

258
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,190
A quad-double!

259
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,530
He nailed it!

260
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,300
<i>He changed the triple to a double?</i>

261
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,560
<i>He's changing the jump elements?</i>

262
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,070
<i>Is he going to add a triple in the second half?</i>

263
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,320
<i>Or is he going back to having three quads?</i>

264
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,240
<i>Do you remember how I told you to focus</i>

265
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,910
<i>more on refining the program 
than being distracted by jumps?</i>

266
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,350
<i>You look too stiff!</i>

267
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,170
<i>This is the part that expresses when 
I showed up as your coach, right?</i>

268
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,300
<i>You look like you didn't like it at all!</i>

269
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,520
<i>A triple Salchow?</i>

270
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,450
<i>No, a quadruple! He stepped out of the landing.</i>

271
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,490
<i>So he did revert the program 
to having three quads.</i>

272
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,790
<i>Shake it off...</i>

273
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,630
<i>Good!</i>

274
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,490
<i>A triple loop!</i>

275
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,380
<i>That was perfect.</i>

276
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,510
<i>Now, Yuri's realized something like love.</i>

277
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,750
<i>The second half's coming up, 
and he already looks tired.</i>

278
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,270
<i>An outside spread eagle,</i>

279
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,620
<i>then an Ina Bauer...</i>

280
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,070
<i>Skate like you're the most beautiful 
person on the ice right now.</i>

281
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,830
<i>A triple axel!</i>

282
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,780
<i>Good, he hung in there.</i>

283
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,090
<i>Next up, a triple flip!</i>

284
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,100
<i>Even though he's not nailing his jumps,</i>

285
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,250
<i>the audience is getting fired up...</i>

286
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,260
<i>It's because he's skating in time with the music.</i>

287
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,930
So close!

288
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,730
<i>Yuri's being too impatient today.</i>

289
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,660
<i>But that's why</i>

290
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,690
<i>you can't look away!</i>

291
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,030
<i>I told you to make the last jump 
a triple for the points...</i>

292
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,670
<i>I wonder who he takes after, to be 
so rebellious toward his coach...</i>

293
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,790
<i>Oh...</i>

294
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,130
<i>It's me!</i>

295
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,260
<i>If I were Yakov, it'd be an instant lecture.</i>

296
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,760
<i>And I've done that, too, but...</i>

297
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,550
Yuri-kun!

298
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,800
He showed his pride as Japan's top skater!

299
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,800
Yuri!!!

300
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,450
Yuri!

301
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,170
Victor!

302
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,950
Oops, watch the nosebleed.

303
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:54,220
The scores, please, for Katsuki Yuri-san. 
His free skate program score: 165.20.

304
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,230
His total score: 259.56.

305
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,610
It's amazing you scored that 
high after a jump like that!

306
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,610
He is currently in first place.

307
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,030
Thanks for proving to me that you're 
able to get a lot of PCS points.

308
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,970
You can score even higher, 
so don't feel down, okay, Yuri?

309
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,420
Yuri-kun!

310
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,970
I totally lost to you.

311
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,980
I want to face you in the 
Grand Prix series someday!

312
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,480
Until then, please don't quit!

313
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,900
And another thing!

314
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,250
Please give me your autograph!

315
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,740
Me, too!

316
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,860
Can I take a photo with you?

317
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,860
Yuri! I was so impressed!

318
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,470
It was so obvious that you took the 
younger skaters seriously as rivals.

319
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,250
What if you'd gotten hurt, slamming 
into the wall like that at the end?!

320
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,190
S-Sorry.

321
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,640
At first, I was just desperate 
because I didn't want to lose,

322
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,260
but somehow, I started having 
a lot of fun in the middle.

323
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,510
I don't remember a lot about it.

324
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,590
Huh?

325
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,140
Yeah...

326
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,980
Anyway, that was the most fun I've ever 
had while skating in competition.

327
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,680
What're you doing, Yuri?

328
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,490
Oh, you saw the photo of Victor and 
the Japanese Yuri, didn't you?

329
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,580
Jealous?

330
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,080
Shut up, hag!

331
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,720
Next, we have the skater Katsuki Yuri,

332
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,420
who's thought to be the next leader 
of men's singles in Japan.

333
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,090
Please, show us.

334
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,100
Um... Please show your theme for this year.

335
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
Skater Katsuki?

336
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,850
Love 
Katsuki Yuri

337
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,850
My theme in this year's 
Grand Prix series is "love."

338
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,420
I've been helped by many people in my 
competitive skating career thus far,

339
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,320
but I've never thought about "love" until now.

340
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,010
Though I was blessed with support, 
I couldn't take full advantage of it.

341
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,870
I always felt like I was fighting alone.

342
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,280
But since Victor showed up to be my coach,

343
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,290
I've seen something totally different.

344
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,460
My "love" is not something 
clear-cut like romantic love,

345
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,600
but the more abstract feeling 
of my relationships

346
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,880
with Victor, family, and hometown...

347
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,380
I was finally able to realize that something 
like love exists all around me.

348
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,890
Victor is the first person I've 
ever wanted to hold on to.

349
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,040
I don't really have a name for that emotion,

350
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,650
but I have decided to call it "love."

351
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,690
Now that I know what love 
is and am stronger for it,

352
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,340
I'll prove it to myself with a 
Grand Prix Final gold medal!

353
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,120
So we...

354
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,720
...were abstract.

355
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,700
After all this time we've supported him...

356
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,670
When you come back, we'll burn that 
unfashionable necktie, Yuri.

357
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,170
Let's buy a new one before the Cup of China.

358
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,570
<i>Victor...</i>

359
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,110
<i>Unfortunately for you, it won't be 
Yuri who wins the Cup of China.</i>

360
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,060
<i>It will be Phichit Chulanont.</i>

361
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,420
Wasn't that jump great?

362
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,130
Did you get a good video of it?

363
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,970
Oh, sorry...

364
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,810
What?!

365
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,820
We have to post it online as soon as possible!

366
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,860
To Be Continued!!!

367
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,860
Dajia hao!

368
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,060
I want to eat Shanghai crab!

369
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,360
Victor, our event is in Beijing.

370
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,620
Crab, crab, shrimp, shrimp, xiao long bao!

371
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,960
