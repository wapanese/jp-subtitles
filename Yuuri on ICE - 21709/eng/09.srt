Maccachin stole some buns, 
and they got stuck in his throat.

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,150
Victor!

3
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,900
Go back to Japan right now.

4
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,720
Can you be Yuri's coach tomorrow, 
for just one day?

5
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,720
Huh?

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,330
Huh?

7
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:42,720
Huh?

8
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,700
<i>Anyway, this is a crisis!</i>

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,460
Ask Yakov anything you don't understand.

10
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,220
If you're in trouble, just hug him,
and he'll help you.

11
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,380
Sorry, Yuri.

12
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,220
Even if I'm not here, I'll always 
be with you in spirit.

13
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,960

Um, it didn't look like you exchanged 
any words with Coach Yakov

17
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,500
at this morning's public practice.

18
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,070
I'm fine!

19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,130
I'll just do what I've always done 
in practice with Victor!

20
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,360
<i>Why did Yakov take on that pork cutlet bowl?</i>

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,890
Yuri, your grandfather's here.

22
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,120
Grandpa, I thought you weren't feeling well.

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,870
Just try these.

24
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,670
<i>There's pork cutlet, scrambled 
eggs, and white rice in here!</i>

25
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,650
<i>What's with this pirozhki?!</i>

26
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,400
It's a pork cutlet bowl pirozhki.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,380
Eat them and do well in today's 
free skate, Yuratchka.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,980
Okay.

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,890
<i>With Victor gone, I'm the only one who can win.</i>

30
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,660

Group Two is finally about to start 
in the Men's Singles Free Skate.

35
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,330
Each skater comes into this event 
with his own hopes and fears.

36
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,650
This event will determine who advances 
to the Grand Prix Final.

37
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,180
Group Two's first competitor,
currently in sixth place,

38
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,680
is the Czech Republic's Emil Nekola, age 18.

39
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,270
He is skating to music from 
the movie <i>Anastasis</i>.

40
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,290
His theme is "Cyberpunk: 
I've ceased to be human."

41
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,170
Just as his theme suggests, he's planned 
four quads, a superhuman feat.

42
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,200
A quadruple Salchow. Beautiful.

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,580
Well done!

44
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,540
Next up is a quadruple jump combination.

45
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,330
Quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop.

46
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,060
I'll take this opportunity 
to clarify something.

47
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,340
I'll make it to the Grand Prix Final
with or without your help, Mickey.

48
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,820
So you need to win without 
my support, too, Mickey.

49
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,220
His next jump will also be a quad.

50
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,510
A quadruple toe loop.

51
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,610
Brilliant!

52
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm not every woman in the world.

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,850
You need to get out more!

54
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,300
I don't need any other woman but you, Sala.

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,580
I was able to focus on skating and come 
this far because you were with me.

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,330
Don't leave me alone, please!

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,770
Become strong, Michele Crispino!

58
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,600
I can skate without your love,

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,690
and I'll start dating!

60
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,050
If he finishes in second or above, 
he may still make the Grand Prix Final.

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,530
<i>Do you like Czech men 
who have nothing but cheer?</i>

62
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,560
<i>Or do you like moody Japanese men 
who look like closet pervs?</i>

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,450
Your short program was super sexy.

64
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,560
Huh? Thanks.

65
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,760
<i>So despite being Italian, you don't 
like men who are negative, Sala?</i>

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,840
A quadruple loop.

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,320
That was perfect!

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,700
So far, we've seen four flawless quads!

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,460
<i>He's not human.</i>

70
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,090
<i>Man, I'm tired...</i>

71
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,910
He'd planned a combination there, but...

72
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,770
He fell and couldn't complete the second jump.

73
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,850
<i>Crap!</i>

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,040
A triple Salchowâ€”

75
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,520
<i>Oops.</i>

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,980
<i>Still going strong!</i>

Yeah!

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,570
Sala, you're not rinkside to 
send him off to the ice today.

83
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,870
We now have Italy's Michele Crispino, age 22.

84
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,070
He finished the short program in fifth.

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,550
Will he make a comeback in the free skate?

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,460
He is skating to "Serenade for Two."

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,340
<i>Sala, are you watching me 
somewhere out there?</i>

88
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,130
<i>I can tell, even when we're apart.</i>

89
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
A quadruple Salchow.

90
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,530
<i>Mickey might be feeling a little down.</i>

91
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,980
A triple flip, single loop, and a triple Salchow.

92
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,340
A three-jump combo!

93
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,490
<i>What should I do with my feelings?</i>

94
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,600
A triple axel.

95
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,490
<i>Compared to practice, his skating 
is much more mellow.</i>

96
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,310
He's like a completely different person.

97
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,500
Did something happen?

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,680
Love.

99
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,430
I can feel lost love in Michele's skating.

100
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,240
<i>Sala, we've been inseparable since birth.</i>

101
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,980
<i>My precious Sala...</i>

102
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,690
<i>My lady...</i>

103
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,030
Why are boys mean to me?

104
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,280
It's because you're cute.

105
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,510
I'll beat them all up!

106
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,760
I got asked on a date again.

107
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,790
I'll beat him up!

108
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,040
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

109

<i>Goodbye, Sala.</i>

114
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,600
A triple Lutz.

Congratulations!

124
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,710
That was the coolest program 
I've seen from you so far.

125
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,850
You thought of me when you 
were skating, right?

126
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,080
Y-Yeah.

127
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,060
I'm sorry for saying such mean things earlier.

128
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,730
But I'm glad I did!

129
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,090
We're better apart, after all!

130

Huh?

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,710

What?

135
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,520
I'm changing the jump composition.

136
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll reduce the number of jumps in 
the first half from four to two.

137
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,160
So you'll have six in the second half?

138
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,990
That's right.

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,170

he suffered a huge loss in the standings

144

the Four Continents Championship.

He is skating to 
"Allegro Appassionato in B Minor."

152
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,280
The program was choreographed 
by Lilia Baranovskaya,

153
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,110
former principal of the Bolshoi Ballet.

154

difficulty and heart-pounding intensity.

156

He's been allowed to attempt 
quads since his senior debut.

157
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,670
Here's the first of two in this program.

158
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,820

he landed that with confidence!

A triple axel from a spiral.

Beauty is a crushing force of righteousness!

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,150
Strength means nothing without beauty.

<i>and JJ has four.</i>

175
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,440
A triple flip.

176
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,390
<i>To beat them, I can't make any mistakes!</i>

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,690
A quadruple toe loop.

178
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,220
Here's a choreographic sequence.

179
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,380
<i>I don't want to lose like that again!</i>

180
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,170
With all eyes on him during the free skate, 
Yuri Plisetsky of Russia, age 15,

181
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,760
is now in first place!

182
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,360
Huh?

183
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,870
Let's climb the podium together again 
at the Rostelecom Cup, Yuri-chan.

184
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,620
<i>That shithead!</i>

185
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,800
Quadruple Salchow, triple toe loop.

186
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,900
A beautiful jump with great height!

187
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,410
He's showing tremendous spirit 
in his program's second half.

188
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,180
A triple loop, double toe loop.

189
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>Here's the last jump combination.</i>

190
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,880
Is this really Yurio?

191
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,010
A triple axel, single loop, and a triple Salchow.

192
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,860
He landed all his jumps!

193
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,470
At the Rostelecom Cup of the Grand 
Prix Series, his senior debut,

194
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,100
he's brushed off the pressure and 
responded to his local fans,

195
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,210
delivering a sublime free skate program!

196
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,060
<i>A performance beyond his limits.</i>

197
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>That must've been what it was.</i>

198
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,090
Yuri Plisetsky from Russia.

RK: 1
Yuri Plisetsky     Total

200
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,590
His free skate score is 199.87, a personal best!

201
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,800
His total score is 297.96.

202
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,240
He's currently in first place.

203
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,230
He's won a ticket to the Grand Prix Final!

204
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,570
How'd you like my free skate, pork cutlet bowl?!

205
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,770
Katsuki Yuri from Japan is in second 
place after the short program.

206
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,420
He is skating to "Yuri on Ice."

207
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,170
<i>I don't want them to think 
everything Victor's taught me</i>

208
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,950
<i>has been a waste.</i>

209
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,980
<i>I have to prove that by winning.</i>

210
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,310
<i>If I fail here, everything is over.</i>

211
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,670
A quadruple toe loop.

212
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,210
<i>I popped it!</i>

213
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,190
What's that pork cutlet bowl doing?

214
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,460
His second jump turned into a single.

215
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,590
<i>Crap, crap...</i>

216
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,600
<i>Calm down. Calm down!</i>

217
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,630
<i>How do I recover from this?</i>

218
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,080
Yuri, you tend to flub your jumps 
when something is on your mind.

219
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,610
Starting today, I'm your coach.

220
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,110
I'll make you win the Grand Prix Final.

221
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,010
<i>How did he know how I felt?</i>

222
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,740
<i>Until Victor came into my life,</i>

223
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,710
<i>I could never openly say that I'd win gold,</i>

224
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,640
<i>but I never skated with the thought 
in my mind that I'd lose anyway.</i>

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,040
That jump had enough rotations.

226
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,900
<i>Truthfully, I wanted to win gold at 
last year's Grand Prix Final, too.</i>

227
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,440
Yuri, you're not weak.

228
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,680
No one else thinks that, either.

229
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Now that I know what love 
is and am stronger for it,

230
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,450
I'll prove it to myself with a 
Grand Prix Final gold medal!

231
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,650
<i>I was able to come this far 
because Victor believed in me.</i>

232
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,490
A triple loop.

233
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,400
<i>If I end here without making 
the Grand Prix Final...</i>

234
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,610
He two-footed that landing.

235
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,340
<i>No.</i>

236
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,860
<i>Don't think right now.</i>

237
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,180
You idiot!

238
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,030
Hang inâ€”

239
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,930
Yuri...

240
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,230
All supportive now that you've 
clinched your spot in the Final, eh?

241
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,870
Cheer for me, too, will you?

242
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,350
Yuri, let's go.

243
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,540
<i>Yurio looked like he'd kick the bucket 
on his last three-jump combo.</i>

244
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,770
<i>Idiot! I have more stamina than him!</i>

245
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,920
A triple axel.

246
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,560
<i>Whether Victor were with me or not,</i>

247
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,150
<i>it would still feel just as tough.</i>

248
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,600
A triple flip.

249
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,590
<i>Keep it simple.</i>

250
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,840
<i>I'm the only one who can skate this 
program with this much appeal.</i>

251
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,200
A triple axel, single loop, and triple Salchow.

252
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,710
A triple Lutz, triple toe loop.

253
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,630
<i>I'm the one who loves this 
program Victor and I made</i>

254
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,260
<i>the most in the whole world!</i>

255
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,010
<i>I'm not finished yet.</i>

256
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,490
<i>I'll be done when I get the gold with Victor.</i>

257
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,010
You can feel Katsuki Yuri's love, 
a love he can only express on the ice,

258
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,690
in this step sequence.

259
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,350
Aw, he had really good flow until the end.

260
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,640
It's too bad.

261
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,860
When you think of how it could've 
been with Victor here,

262
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,100
you really want to see that, right?

263
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,480
<i>That was the toughest program 
I've done so far...</i>

264
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,970
Hey.

265
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,460
You totally failed to take advantage 
of the program Vitya made for you!

266
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,490
Why didn't you practice for the 
possibility that you might flub a jump?

267
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,980
<i>He's just like Victor... A huge 
lecture at the kiss and cry.</i>

268
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,040
Victor never did, either.

269
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,530
I guess he never learned differently as a coach.

270
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,820
We have Katsuki Yuri's scores.

Katsuki Yuri     Total

His total score is 282.84.

He's currently in third place.

275
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,380
He may yet advance to the Grand Prix Final,

276
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,730
but we won't know until the end.

277
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
That's a higher score than I expected.

278
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,220
What's wrong?

279
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,760
Spasibo.

280
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,270
<i>Victor will go back to Russia soon.</i>

281
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,270
The final competitor is 
Jean-Jacques Leroy, age 19.

282
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,270
<i>I'm so tired of waiting.</i>

283
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>I bet you all agree, right?</i>

284
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,910
He is skating to "Partizan Hope."

285
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,200
<i>Yuri Katsuki, Victor may have chosen you,</i>

286
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,410
<i>but you're no king.</i>

287
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,390
<i>I can tell that much by your free skate.</i>

288
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,030
<i>I am the only king!</i>

289
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,000
A quadruple Salchow.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,810
Success!

291
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,690
He's planned four quads in this program.

292
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,380
If all of them are successful,

293
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,600
his free skate program

294
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,240
has the highest technical difficulty 
among all the skaters.

295
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,700
Next up is a quad-triple combination.

296
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,970
Quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop.

297
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,030
At Skate Canada, this year's
first Grand Prix event,

298
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,660
he held off Russia's Yuri Plisetsky, 
winning for the second time.

299
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,230
In last year's Grand Prix Final, 
he finished third.

300
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,470
With Victor Nikiforov absent this season,

301
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,540
a new prince in the figure skating 
world has been born.

302
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,440
<i>Wrong.</i>

303
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,030
<i>I'm no prince.</i>

304
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,590
<i>I'm already a king!</i>

305
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,190
<i>"I'll be the hero who stops 
Victor from becoming the</i>

306
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>consecutive five-time world champion."</i>

307
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,590
<i>That's what I was thinking 
when I made this program,</i>

308
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,670
<i>but I had no idea Victor would go on break.</i>

309
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,040
<i>I bet he ran because he was 
afraid of losing to me.</i>

310
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,140
<i>That poor guy, Victor Nikiforov!</i>

311
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,800
A triple axel.

312
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
<i>Dad, Mom,</i>

313
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,690
<i>my precious girlfriend,</i>

314
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,050
<i>the great people of Canada,</i>

315
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,570
<i>and everyone who loves skating...</i>

316
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,550
<i>This is for you.</i>

317
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,130
<i>This isn't enough love!</i>

318
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,010
A quadruple Lutz.

319
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,600
Nailed it!

320
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,210
<i>It's not just that I land all the jumps with ease.</i>

321
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,240
<i>They're integrated into the overall 
performance, are they not?</i>

322
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,440
A triple flip, single loop, and triple Salchow.

323
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,300
Amazing.

324
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,780
A superb jump combination!

325
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,810
<i>Hey, judges!</i>

326
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,820
<i>This is JJ!</i>

327
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,930
His last jump will be a quad.

328
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,350
So far, there have been no mistakes.

329
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,950
<i>Let's go!</i>

330
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,330
A quadruple toe loop.

331
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,440
He's landed all his jumps!

332
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,370
JJ will take first in the free skate, as well.

333
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,900
Yuri Plisetsky will place second,

334
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,650
with Michele Crispino in third.

335
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,220
Katsuki Yuri will be fourth.

336
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,100
When you total both competition scores,

337
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,840
Michele and Katsuki have 
the same overall score.

338
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,410
<i>Since we're tied in points,</i>

339
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,460
<i>I can squeak into the Final because 
I placed second in the Cup of China.</i>

340
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,570
<i>The Rostelecom Cup is over.</i>

341
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,840
<i>The final six who will advance 
to the Grand Prix Final are</i>

342
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,330
<i>the three who had basically 
been confirmed already...</i>

343
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,580
<i>JJ, who cemented his win 
with another high score,</i>

344
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,600
<i>Yurio, who finished second, and...</i>

345
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,180
Man, I'm tired.

346
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,050
You don't have to come support me at the 
Women's Free Skate tomorrow, Mickey.

347
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,020
Can't I at least cheer you on?

348
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,180
You'd just rush right to the kiss and cry again.

349
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,040
Yuri, congrats on qualifying 
for the Grand Prix Final!

350
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,820
I knew you'd make it.

351
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,070
Sala!

352
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,880
Thanks.

353
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
What are you doing?!

354
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,730
Huh?

355
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,280
Was that Mickey screaming?

356
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,390
What's this? A hugging competition?

357
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
JJ isâ€”

358
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,660
Huh?!

359
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Stay away from me!

360
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,220
<i>I'm this close to the peak of my 
competitive figure skating career.</i>

361
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,510
<i>I really want the gold now.</i>

362
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,680
<i>The Grand Prix Final will be my last chance.</i>

363
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,950
<i>Even if I don't win gold,</i>

364
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,610
<i>I'll have Victor step down as coach 
after the Grand Prix Final, and...</i>

365
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,350
There you are, pork cutlet bowl.

366
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,650
You made me look for you.

367
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,960
Oh, Yurio...

368
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,640
What was that earlier?

369
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,130
Stop creeping me out!

370
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,720
And what was that free skate, anyway?

371
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,450
You can make the excuse that you couldn't do your best because Victor wasn't there,

372
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,790
but I was in top form and 
earned a new personal best,

373
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,460
only to lose to JJ again!

374
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,950
You have no right to feel more 
down than me, pork cutlet bowl!

375
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,650
You can have it.

376
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,220
It's almost your birthday, right?

377
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,080
Huh?

378
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,970
Pirozhki?

379
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,890
Eat.

380
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,130
Huh? Right here?

381
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,980
Eat!

382
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,770
There's rice in this...

383
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,660
Pork cutlet and egg, too.

384
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,810
It's a pork cutlet bowl!

385
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,470
That's right!

386
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
My grandpa made them himself!

387
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,490
Great, aren't they?

388
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,510
Yeah!

389
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,800
They're vkusno!

390
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,480
Fukuoka Airport International Terminal

391
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
<i>I have a lot I want to tell you, Victor.</i>

392
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,190
<i>What do I say first?</i>

393
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,310
Yuri...

394
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,360
I've been thinking about what I can 
do as your coach from now on.

395
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,810
Me, too.

396
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,400
Please be my coach until I retire!

397
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,800
It's almost like a marriage proposal.

398
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,550
I wish you'd never retire.

399
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,280
Let's win gold together at 
the Grand Prix Final.

400
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,990
To Be Continued!!!

401
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,990
Yay! I'm finally on vacation!

402
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,890
Where's my swimsuit?

403
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,450
It may be a resort, 
but it's the middle of winter!

404
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,770
Oh, right. It's almost Christmas.

405
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,500
What are you going to give me, Yuri?

406
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,750
Something round and golden.

407
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,520
Wow!

408
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,850
Next time, Tenth Skate:

409
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,000
Tenth Skate 
Gotta Supercharge It! 
Pre-Grand Prix Final Special!

410
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,000
Gotta Supercharge It!

411
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
Pre-Grand Prix Final Special!
