00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,400
<i>In life, you need vacations 
where you can be yourself,</i>

2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,410
<i>away from your hectic everyday life.</i>

3
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,370
<i>When I get away from skating, 
two "L words" come to mind:</i>

4
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>life and love.</i>

5
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,920
<i>I've been neglecting both 
for over twenty years.</i>

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Tenth Skate 
Gotta Supercharge It!! 
Pre-Grand Prix Final Special!

7
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,950
Gotta Supercharge It!!

8
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,140
Pre-Grand Prix Final Special!

9
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,430
<i>Even Barcelona's cold in December.</i>

10
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,390
I thought, other than me, only a Russian

11
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,100
would be stupid enough to get 
in the pool this time of year.

12
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,100
I guess I was right.

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,660
Chris!

14
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,610
Hi, Coach Victor!

15
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,280
And here I was hoping to go skinny dipping.

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,610
Don't let me stop you.

17
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,740
I'll even take photos for you.

18
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,070
<i>My name is Victor Nikiforov.</i>

19
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,130
<i>I was kidding about being on vacation.</i>

20
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,380
<i>I just arrived in Barcelona, Spain, for 
the Grand Prix Figure Skating Final.</i>

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,130
<i>He's Christophe Giacometti from Switzerland.</i>

22
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,130
Since you left, I'm one of the oldest...

23
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,640
And I'm only 25.

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,390
<i>Nowadays, Chris is sexy 
both on and off the ice,</i>

25
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,920
<i>but when I first met him at the 
European Championships,</i>

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,150
<i>he was like a little boy running 
through the Swiss meadows.</i>

27
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,480
<i>I've shared the podium with Chris 
at many a Grand Prix Final,</i>

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,200
<i>European Championship, 
and World Championship.</i>

29
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,180
<i>I can't imagine a skating season without him,</i>

30
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,280
<i>and he has said that</i>

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,180
<i>he wouldn't be motivated in a 
season without me, either.</i>

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,130
<i>Despite all that, he was savvy enough</i>

33
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,960
<i>to make it to the Grand Prix Final.</i>

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
Yuri!

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,820
At least check yourself in.

36
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,180
You do it, Yakov.

37
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm tired.

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,720
Yuratchka!

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,820
Autograph, please!

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,520
Can I get a photo with you?

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,440
You ug—

42
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,790
Yuri Plisetsky, don't use unattractive words.

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,650
<i>From Russia, we have Yuri Plisetsky.</i>

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,770
<i>At just 15, he's qualified for the GP Final 
first thing in his senior debut.</i>

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,420
<i>He's a tomboy cat under my former coach, Yakov.</i>

46
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,850
<i>After visiting Japan,</i>

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,530
Yurio

48
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,030
<i>he's been called by his nickname, "Yurio."</i>

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,020
<i>It's well-known that he has rabid 
fans called "Yuri's Angels,"</i>

50
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,790
Meow

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,570
<i>who appear at every competition.</i>

52
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,790
Wow, he's so popular.

53
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,750
Yuri's Angels are famous.

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,800
Huh...

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,120
But JJ Girls are better about following the rules,

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,680
and we're cuter.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,620
Don't diss my fans and call 
them ugly, you ugly-ass bitch!

58
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,830
So scary.

59
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,140
Help, JJ.

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,400
Oh, he's just jealous because 
my fiancée is so beautiful.

61
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,810
<i>I think he's the one named 
Jean-Jacques Leroy, from Canada.</i>

62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,740
<i>He's a strong gold medal candidate,</i>

63
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,760
<i>but he has a certain unapproachable 
quality the other competitors don't.</i>

64
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,790
Any guy who wears sunglasses 
on his head is scum.

65
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,120
Find someone better, ugly-ass bitch!

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,500
Hey, don't be so uppity.

67
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,830
Scary!

68
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,600
Otabek!

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,910
Where are you going?

70
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,260
Out to eat.

71
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,490
<i>Otabek Altin from Kazakhstan, age 18.</i>

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,380
<i>He rushed into the GP Final at full speed.</i>

73
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,270
<i>Ever since he shared the podium with me</i>

74
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,270
<i>at Worlds last season, I've sensed 
a certain presence about him.</i>

75
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,710
<i>But people don't know much 
about his personal life.</i>

76
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
Eating alone?

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,650
You're still an odd one, huh?

78
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,660
Want to join us for dinner?

79
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,110
Thanks, but I'll pass.

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,230
<i>It appears he's not interested in 
socializing with other skaters.</i>

81
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,070
Huh?

82
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,460
What's with you, asshole?

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,340
Yuri's not answering.

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,430
Ugh, I can't wait any longer!

85
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm going to Sagrada Família!

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,310
Just go.

87
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay!

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,270
<i>Phichit Chulanont from Thailand.</i>

89
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,360
<i>He won the Cup of China,</i>

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
<i>becoming the first Southeast Asian figure 
skater to qualify for the Grand Prix Final,</i>

91
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,610
<i>but I feel he's also peerless when 
it comes to skillful selfies.</i>

92
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,320
<i>He was Yuri's rink mate in Detroit,</i>

93
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,280
<i>and Yuri says he's the only foreign 
skater he considers a friend.</i>

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,650
<i>And among the six qualifiers for the Final,</i>

95
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,790
Top 6 Men's Singles Figure Skaters

96
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,790
<i>the last one, who made it by a hair's width,</i>

97
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,800
<i>is this jet-lagged sleeping beauty, 
Katsuki Yuri from Japan.</i>

98
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,050
<i>I've come here with him as his coach.</i>

99
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,010
<i>After the Rostelecom Cup,</i>

100
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,130
<i>Yuri spent his few remaining days</i>

101
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,310
Congratulations on Qualifying for the GPF 2 Years in a Row! 
Thank You, Katsuki Yuri and Coach Victor Nikiforov!

102
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,310
<i>until the Final maximizing his practice time.</i>

103
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,870
<i>When I think about it,</i>

104
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,120
<i>it's already been eight months 
since I first came to Hasetsu.</i>

105
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,980
<i>I can't remember when I last spent 
this much time with Maccachin.</i>

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,150
<i>Every day, I've been able to bathe 
in a bath bigger than any tub,</i>

107
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,490
<i>and I can eat all the delicious 
pork cutlet bowls I want.</i>

108
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,030
<i>This is heaven on Earth.</i>

109
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,290
<i>Yuri's life and love have taught me</i>

110
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,540
<i>about a brand new world that 
I'd never known before.</i>

111
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,140
Huh?

112
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,960
Where's Victor?

113
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,640
Oh, he's at the pool with Chris.

114
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,860
Oh! Phichit-kun's...

115
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,150
JJ...

116
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,110
Yurio...

117
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,900
Wow.

118
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,590
"Now that I know what love 
is and am stronger for it,

119
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,820
I'll prove it to myself with a Grand 
Prix Final gold medal," huh?

120
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,950
Help me, Victor.

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,710
Yuri!

122
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,570
I'm freezing!

123
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,100
Please draw a hot bath!

124
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,030
Yuri, can you make coffee, too?

125
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,280
You were still asleep?

126
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,870
Whoa!

127
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,760
Y-You're freezing!

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,240
Quit clinging to me! Both of you!

129
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,220
<i>The aggressive jump composition 
Yuri's planned in order to win</i>

130
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,010
<i>includes a quadruple flip, which he's yet 
to land, as his final free skate jump.</i>

131
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,090
<i>If he sticks with his old jumps,</i>

132
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,380
<i>even if he skates a flawless program, 
JJ has a higher base score.</i>

133
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay.

134
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,310
I'm done with practice!

135
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,760
Off I go!

136
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,770
Yuri, let's go over it one last time.

137
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,970
Yuri, what do you want to do now?

138
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,020
I recommend a good night's rest to 
prepare for tomorrow's short program.

139
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,370
Don't be such a model coach now.

140
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,640
This is my first time in Barcelona, 
so take me sightseeing.

141
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,780
Leave it to me!

142
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,540
Yeah!

143
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,910
Salud!

144
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,920
Perfecto!

145
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,380
Yeah!

146
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,300
I haven't shopped in ages. This is fun!

147
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,050
Hey, let me take a breather.

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,810
I would've liked to shop when 
the Euro was weaker, though.

149
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,800
You don't want anything, Yuri?

150
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,300
Oh... Nah.

151
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,360
<i>Every competitor has a different 
way of winding down.</i>

152
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,880
<i>It's unusual for Yuri to suggest sightseeing.</i>

153
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,800
<i>It might mean he's just that 
nervous this time around.</i>

154
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,930
<i>Okay, then...</i>

155
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,780
Yuri!

156
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,320
I'll buy you a suit for your birthday!

157
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,490
I think you should burn the suit and tie 
you wore at that press conference.

158
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,850
Huh?

159
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,180
Wait, you don't have to!

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,410
I kind of like that suit!

161
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,410
Hey, Victor!

162
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Where's Yuratchka?

163
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,420
We're about to have a fan meeting.

164
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,680
I can smell Yuratchka! 
It's coming from over here!

165
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,310
Oh, this hair is Yuratchka's!

166
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,460
<i>Crap...</i>

167
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,180
<i>How do I get myself out of this?</i>

168
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,710
Yuri, get on.

169
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,190
Huh? You're...

170
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,860
There's Yuratchka!

171
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,050
Huh? No way!

172
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,940
It's Otabek Altin from Kazakhstan!

173
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,830
Huh? What?

174
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,070
Are you coming or not?

175
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,310
<i>I'm sure athletes aren't the 
only ones who are sensitive</i>

176
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,430
<i>to tailwinds that can take 
one to worlds unknown.</i>

177
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,880
<i>News that the hero of Kazakhstan 
kidnapped the fairy of Russia</i>

178
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,190
The fairy of Russia, Yuri Plisetsky, rides off on 
a motorbike with Otabek, the hero of Kazakhstan

179
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,840
<i>spread across the world like wildfire.</i>

180
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,940
<i>However, the hero didn't lure 
the fairy out on a mere whim.</i>

181
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,240
<i>Yurio thought they had nothing in common,</i>

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,220
<i>but five years prior, they had 
actually trained together</i>

183
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,350
<i>at Yakov's summer camp.</i>

184
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,030
Really?

185
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,850
I don't remember that!

186
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,350
At the time, I was in my first 
year in the junior division.

187
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,110
But I couldn't keep up with 
the Russian junior skaters,

188
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,900
so I was put in the novice class.

189
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,370
That's where I met you.

190
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,750
Yuri Plisetsky had the 
unforgettable eyes of a soldier.

191
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,120
A soldier?

192
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,330
Me?

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,410
I had just moved my home rink 
from Moscow to St. Petersburg.

194
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,100
I was desperate.

195
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,810
I'd decided that I wouldn't complain 
until I was good enough.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
After that camp,

197
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,740
I moved around to train, from Russia 
to the US and then to Canada.

198
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,270
I only managed to return to my 
home rink in Almaty last year.

199
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,100
Now, more than ever, I want to win 
the championship for Kazakhstan.

200
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,220
Otabek, why did you talk to me?

201
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,450
I'm a rival, aren't I?

202
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,910
I've always thought we were alike.

203
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,550
That's all.

204
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,410
Are you going to become friends 
with me or not?

205
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,640
<i>Yurio had never been asked 
to become friends before!</i>

206
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,800
<i>Now, back to the main story 
where I'm shopping with Yuri.</i>

207
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,480
<i>Here, the mood had turned sour!</i>

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,000
It's not here, either.

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,310
Yuri, calm down and remember.

210
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,870
It's the bag of nuts we just bought.

211
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,320
It's a brown bag with green print.

212
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,100
Sorry.

213
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,820
I have no idea where I dropped it.

214
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,540
I'll go back to the shop and get another bag!

215
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,010
It's okay, Yuri.

216
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,500
The nuts shop would be closed by now.

217
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,420
Let's head back. You're tired, right?

218
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,620
You don't have to say it like that!

219
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,050
Well, I'm tired.

220
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,380
<i>We ended up walking in silence, looking
around at the nearby Christmas market.</i>

221
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,020
Victor, your birthday is Christmas Day, right?

222
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,800
Yeah.

223
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,380
What would you like for your gift?

224
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,270
In Russia, we don't celebrate 
before the actual birthday.

225
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,230
We don't really celebrate Christmas, either.

226
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,230
I see.

227
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,170
Do you want some hot wine, too?

228
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,240
Ah, I try not to drink before a competition.

229
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,010
Oh, right.

230
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>When Yuri's searching for an answer,</i>

231
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>his eyes sparkle, even if he doesn't say anything.</i>

232
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,710
<i>He's looking for something 
right now, like a dowsing rod.</i>

233
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,420
<i>I'll just watch over him 
without making conversation.</i>

234
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,230
Victor!

235
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,850
Let's go in this store!

236
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,730
Can you show me these two in front?

237
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,730
<i>I've always wanted a lucky charm.</i>

238
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,990
<i>I-It's a lucky charm so that I 
can do my best in the Final!</i>

239
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,490
<i>It's also a thank you gift to 
Victor for all of his help.</i>

240
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,000
This one, please. I'll pay in installments.

241
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,750
<i>Sometimes, when backed into a corner,</i>

242
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>athletes can act completely unexpectedly.</i>

243
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,230
Thank you for everything up to now.

244
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,120
I... I couldn't think of something better.

245
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,700
But, um...

246
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,070
I'll try my best from tomorrow on, so...

247
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,780
Tell me something for good luck.

248
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,830
Sure.

249
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,690
I'll say something you won't 
even have to think about.

250
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,840
Tomorrow, show me the skating that 
you can honestly say you liked best.

251
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,020
Okay!

252
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,180
<i>That's the only shortcut to 
a gold medal that I know.</i>

253
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,870
I'm hungry.

254
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,330
Let's go grab a bite.

255
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,390
<i>I have absolute faith in what you decide, Yuri.</i>

256
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,120
AGHHHHH

257
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,120
What's wrong, Mari-chan?

258
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,000
Yurio looks like he's enjoying 
having tea with someone!

259
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,000
Whoa, really?

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,770
It's Otabek from Kazakhstan!

261
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,010
Oh, Minako-sensei, Mari-neechan. 
You're already here.

262
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,640
Crap, crap, crap.

263
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,590
Yuri, we need a huge favor!

264
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,530
You're way too happy about this.

265
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,530
I could just die right now!

266
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,230
Why did we all have to get together?

267
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,230
How much should I pay you?

268
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,230
Hello, ladies.

269
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,790
Still, it's kind of weird for us 
all to be here like this

270
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,200
Yurio, have some shrimp!

271
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,200
Picture, picture!

272
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,840
Oh, sure.

273
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,370
before the Final starts.

274
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,580
At last year's Final,

275
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,250
I was always by myself, even at the banquet.

276
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,700
I couldn't even talk to Victor.

277
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,000
Yuri, you don't remember?

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,890
What?

279
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,130
Yuri, you got drunk on champagne 
and started dancing.

280
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,920
Everyone saw it.

281
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,590
Huh?!

282
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,220
That was disgusting as hell.

283
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,090
I was dragged into a dance-off 
and got humiliated, too!

284
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,520
A dance-off?

285
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,340
With Yurio?

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,220
I did mine with a pole dance, half-naked.

287
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,120
I start going off the rails 
when I drink, just like my

288
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,860
Kyushu born-and-bred dad, 
so I was trying to lay off, but...

289
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,730
<i>The banquet refers to the party 
held after the competition.</i>

290
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,990
<i>Learning proper social skills and etiquette 
is also important for skaters.</i>

291
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,470
What's wrong, Yuri?

292
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,280
<i>Last year, Yuri suffered a 
crushing defeat in the Final.</i>

293
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,280
You look so glum.

294
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,490
Have you had anything to drink?

295
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,750
<i>He looked like his coach had 
dragged him to the banquet.</i>

296
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,750
To eat?

297
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,500
There's pizza...

298
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,500
<i>At least, at first.</i>

299
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,210
<i>Since he couldn't mingle 
well with other skaters,</i>

300
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,750
<i>he kept drinking champagne, and...</i>

301
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,090
I still have videos of what happened.

302
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,660
I do, too.

303
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,990
Wait, what?

304
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,160
Yuri, that's so dirty.

305
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,790
I want to see!

306
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,100
Don't look!

307
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,060
W-Wait... Cut it out already!

308
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,300
Isn't this amazing?

309
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,470
What's with the rings, you two?

310
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,040
Huh? Rings?

311
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,400
I don't remember you wearing that.

312
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,630
U-Um, this is...

313
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,690
They're a pair!

314
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,360
Congrats on your marriage!

315
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Wait, no...

316
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,950
Um...

317
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,010
Everyone!

318
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,400
My good friend here got married!

319
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,340
N-No, this is, um...

320
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,760
It's to thank him for all his help...

321
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,600
And lots of other things... Yes, other things!

322
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,850
Yeah, don't get the wrong idea.

323
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,400
This is an engagement ring.

324
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,100
We'll get married once he wins a gold medal.

325
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,520
What?

326
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,090
Right, Yuri?

327
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,200
V-Victor!

328
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,280
A gold...

329
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,410
...medal...

330
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,780
...huh?

331
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,290
Uh, well, um...

332
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,450
Wait a second!

333
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,790
I'll be the one who wins gold 
and gets married, of course!

334
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,070
That's right, it'll definitely be JJ.

335
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,630
Sorry we can't congratulate you 
on that future marriage.

336
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,530
Well, tomorrow's an early start. 
Better call it a night.

337
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,720
Huh, what?

338
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,310
Hey, wait a second.

339
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,140
I was just joking!

340
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,900
Kick Kick

341
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,470
Victor Nikiforov is dead!

342
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,480
Why do you look so happy to be 
looking after that damn pig?

343
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,650
Did you want to compete against me?

344
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,140
Don't be so full of yourself.

345
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,570
Not all skaters look up to you.

346
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,530
Just go away already, geezer.

347
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,560
The ring you got from that pig is garbage.

348
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,280
I'll win just to prove how 
incompetent his owner is.

349
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,010
Let me go!

350
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,270
<i>If I'd stayed in Russia as a competitor,</i>

351
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,310
<i>Yurio wouldn't be this motivated to fight.</i>

352
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,740
<i>And neither would I...</i>

353
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,940
This place reminds me of Hasetsu's ocean.

354
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,200
I thought that, too.

355
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,540
<i>Yuri, you may not realize this,</i>

356
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,220
<i>but many others besides me 
got their "L words" from you.</i>

357
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,100
Wow!

358
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,230
It feels like it's really happening.

359
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,100
Mari-chan, take my picture!

360
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,360
Sala!

361
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,510
Why are you here, Mickey?

362
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm the one who made it to the Final!

363
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,550
I'm standing guard to make sure 
the hyenas don't touch you!

364
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,250
Let's go to a club after this!

365
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,500
Not her again.

366
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,130
Guang-hong, can you watch it on your end?

367
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,510
Nope, the live stream isn't working for me.

368
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,760
Grand Prix Final in Barcelona
Katsuki Yuri Cheering Party!

369
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,760
I'll be the head cheerleader 
at tonight's public viewing!

370
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,570
The Grand Prix Final is here 
in Barcelona, Spain!

371
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,250
Tonight, it's the Men's Singles Short Program.

372
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,760
Victor...

373
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,520
After this season ends,

374
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,460
my family runs a hot spring 
resort, so please come.

375
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,780
If I win this dance-off...

376
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,980
You'll become my coach, right?

377
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,510
Be my coach, Victor!

378
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,900
To Be Continued!!!

379
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,740
Hola! I'm the figure skater Oda Nobunari!

380
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,200
Oda-kun!

381
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,930
Nobu-kun, over here!

382
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,490
Vic-chan! Yuri-kun!

383
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,750
Huh? What's with those rings?

384
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,520
Next time, Eleventh Skate:

385
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,780
Gotta Super-Supercharge It!!

386
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:26,000
Eleventh Skate
Gotta Super-Supercharge It!!

387
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,420
