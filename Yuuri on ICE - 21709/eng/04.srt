00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,070
8:50 PM 
May 7 (Sunday)

2
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,580
Sorry! I overslept!

3
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,290
U-Um...

4
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,720
Good morning, Yuri!

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,590
Only Aeroflot has kept me 
waiting as long as you have.

6
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,100
Oh, Japanese dogeza!

7
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,600
<i>Victor will be staying in 
Hasetsu to be my coach.</i>

8
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,700
<i>But to me, it's surreal, more like 
having a god around than a coach.</i>

9
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,350
Resting is a part of work, too.

10
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,570
<i>To think that a coach of my very own 
is going to be here every day...</i>

11
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,240
<i>And that coach is Victor Nikiforov himself.</i>

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,160
<i>He said I could pay his coaching fees later,</i>

13
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,270
<i>but I wonder how expensive it will be.</i>

14
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,210
Yuri, you tend to flub your jumps 
when something is on your mind.

15
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,760
Fourth Skate 
Like Yourself... 
And Complete the Free Program!!

16
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,760
Like Yourself... And Complete the Free Program!!

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,260
Hasetsu Hot Springs 
Yu-topia Katsuki

18
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,010
Yuri, maybe we should nix having 
three quads in your free program.

19
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,760
But...

20
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,750
I-If I want to win the Grand 
Prix Final, I need those.

21
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,660
Why?

22
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,270
Even if there's only one quad,

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,520
just get a perfect score on 
the program components!

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,400
Figure Skating Scoring System

25
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,030
<i>Let me pause here to explain the 
scoring system in figure skating!</i>

26
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,010
Technical Elements Score (TES)

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,540
<i>Jumps and spins count 
toward a technical score.</i>

28
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,510
Program Components Score (PCS)

29
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,940
<i>Choreography and interpretation count 
toward a presentation score.</i>

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,790
TES + PCS

31
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,790
Deductions

32
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,790
<i>The total score is a sum of those 
two, minus any deductions!</i>

33
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,790
Total Score

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,410
<i>When I skate, I tend to lose technical 
points by missing jumps,</i>

35
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,800
<i>but close the gap through 
the presentation score.</i>

36
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,380
<i>At any rate, this isn't good enough.</i>

37
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>I have to change.</i>

38
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,560
Yuri, do you know why I decided 
to become your coach?

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,430
Huh?

40
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,210
I was drawn to you because of the music...

41
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,880
The way you skate like your 
body is creating music.

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,570
I want to create a high-difficulty 
program to maximize that.

43
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,320
Only I can do that.

44
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,070
That's the gut feeling I had...

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,280
And the short program validated it!

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,030
Perhaps you should produce 
your next free program.

47
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,540
Huh?

48
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,790
But my coach has always chosen my music—

49
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,320
Ow, ow, ow!

50
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,260
Isn't it more fun to do it yourself?

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,260
That hurts!

52
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,460
But my previous coach...

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,800
Who was your coach again?

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,020
Th-Thank you, God...

55
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,800
Yuri?

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,290
Ciao, ciao!

57
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,040
I haven't seen you since the Grand Prix Final!

58
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,850
Oh, it's been a while.

59
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,110
I hear Victor's your coach now?

60
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,690
Uh, sorry.

61
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,410
Why are you apologizing?

62
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,190
Ciao, ciao, Celestino!

63
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm his coach, Victor!

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,780
You're playing at being a coach in Japan?

65
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,320
Cut it out already.

66
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,910
Hey, hey...

67
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,200
Why didn't you let Yuri 
choose his program music?

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,170
Huh?

69
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,570
I usually select music for my skaters,

70
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,960
but I also let them choose if they want.

71
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,220
Yuri only brought me a piece once.

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,460
I believe it was composed by an acquaintance.

73
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,460
It wasn't bad, but...

74
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,820
You think you can win with this music?

75
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,220
Uh...

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,390
Please choose the music for me after all, Coach.

77
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,320
Yuri never had confidence in himself.

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,100
I told him time and again 
to trust himself more, but...

79
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,210
Okay, thanks.

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,310
U-Um, Celestino...

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,110
I'm going to redeem myself at 
the next Grand Prix Final!

82
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,590
That's what I wanted to hear you say 
at last year's Grand Prix Final.

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,840
I'm so glad.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,870
I couldn't bring myself to 
contact him for so long...

85
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,130
Yuri.

86
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,020
Could I hear this music he mentioned?

87
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,650
Uh...

88
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,100
Why didn't you tell me?

89
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,780
I'm your coach, aren't I?

90
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,130
Right. Sorry.

91
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,140
Huh?

92
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,890
That little piggy's producing 
his own free program?

93
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,520
<i>How are you, Yuri-kun in Russia?</i>

94
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,180
<i>Did you choose your free program?</i>

95
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,590
<i>I look forward to seeing it.</i>

96
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,030
Is Yuko trying to scout the enemy?

97
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,780
Damn it.

98
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,170
<i>But producing his own program, huh?</i>

99
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,140
Oh?

100
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,730
Yuri, did you go to Japan to find a girlfriend?

101
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,700
No. Get off me, Mila.

102
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,110
Are you horny because you 
dumped that hockey player?

103
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,830
I wouldn't put myself in that situation.

104
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,580
I won't get myself almost killed just 
for going on a date with another girl.

105
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,600
I've been practicing lifts lately, too.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Let me down, hag!

107
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,590
I'm only three years older than you.

108
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,220
Yuri. Mila.

109
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,680
Coach Yakov...

110
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,810
Put me down already! Come on!

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,130
Are you two switching to pairs skating?

112
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,350
S-Sorry.

113
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,110
I wonder what happened to Yuri in Japan.

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,670
He used to hate practice.

115
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,020
He was arrogant about his abilities

116
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,860
because no one in his age group rivaled him.

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,040
But I think his face-off with Yuri Katsuki 
in Japan was his wake-up call.

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,030
This may make things interesting.

119
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,270
Hey!

120
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,870
Huh?

121
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,500
It's Lilia Baranovskaya!

122
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,750
The former prima ballerina 
of the Bolshoi Ballet!

123
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,630
Thank you for coming, Lilia.

124
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,170
So which one is he?

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,480
If I don't like what I see, I'll go home.

126
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
Who's this hag?

127
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,270
No cavities.

128
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Ow, ow, ow!

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,640
Physically, he's abysmal.

130
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,690
We start from square one with ballet lessons.

131
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,770
Do what you want.

132
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,920
What the hell?!

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,780
I will choreograph your free program.

134
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,780
First, I've decided on your next goal.

135
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,070
Become this season's principal—

136
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,160
no, prima ballerina.

137
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,410
If you are willing to sell your soul to win.

138
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,270
P-Prima ballerina?

139
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,550
If selling my soul is all it takes to win,

140
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll give you my whole body, no holds barred.

141
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,300
I am Lilia Baranovskaya.

142
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,290
Go home and pack up your things.

143
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,810
You'll be living with me from now on to practice.

144
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,810
With Yakov, too.

145
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,060
Lilia!

146
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,770
Don't get me wrong, Yakov.

147
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,620
I don't intend to get back together with you.

148
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,550
Huh? What?

149
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,070
I... I wasn't hoping for that at all!

150
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,290
I don't really get it,

151
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,090
but Yurio-kun's coach brought in his ex-wife.

152
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,500
Now he's getting scolded by her day and night.

153
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,830
Huh, I see.

154
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,580
Have you chosen the music for 
your free program, Yuri-kun?

155
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,330
Oh, well, I had Victor listen to one...

156
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,710
Oh, I see. So this is how it sounds.

157
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,990
But his reaction was lukewarm.

158
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
The Smackdown

159
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,960
You should think of other possibilities.

160
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,720
<i>My usual way was to have my coach pick 
something from what was available,</i>

161
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
<i>and to let him choreograph it, too.</i>

162
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,780
<i>But Victor wasn't like that.</i>

163
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,310
<i>He choreographed his own programs and 
had new music written to create stories.</i>

164
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,180
<i>I did dream about doing that
myself someday, but...</i>

165
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,970
Oh, Phichit-kun...

166
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,930
He's practicing back home in Thailand.

167
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,210
Hey, Phichit-kun?

168
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,050
Sawasdee krab.

169
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,150
Yuri!

170
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,050
It's been a while. How have you been?

171
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,550
You're practicing back in Thailand, huh?

172
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,480
Yeah, Detroit's boring now that you're gone.

173
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,570
Oh, you should come visit Bangkok.

174
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,110
I'll show you around.

175
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,810
Khob khun, kup.

176
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,190
Hey, Phichit-kun, do you remember 
how I had a music demo made?

177
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,130
Oh, yeah!

178
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,770
By the conservatory student?

179
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,950
You asked her to compose it, right?

180
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,830
Yeah. It got shelved in the end...

181
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,170
Sorry, and after you spent time composing it...

182
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,830
Oh, it's fine. Just keep it.

183
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,670
Sorry.

184
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,780
Things got awkward with her after that.

185
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,170
Oh, I see...

186
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,800
I'll put out feelers to see where she is.

187
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm sure she's not mad or anything.

188
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,100
<i>This piece has been bothering me for a while.</i>

189
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,640
<i>It really is a bit weak...</i>

190
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,560
<i>But I guess that makes sense.</i>

191
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,440
<i>I asked her to compose a piece that'd 
express my whole career as a skater.</i>

192
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,560
<i>She did capture it pretty well...</i>

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,950
<i>My underwhelming life in 
competitive figure skating.</i>

194
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,490
<i>What should I have done differently?</i>

195
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,060
No! No!

196
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,220
Not like that at all!

197
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,790
Throw yourself away!

198
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,980
Your past self is dead!

199
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,120
People who can be reborn as many times 
as necessary are the strong ones.

200
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Welcome, Victor!
Welcome Back, Katsuki Yuri

201
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,300
What? You still haven't chosen the music?

202
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,230
Why can't you trust your own decisions?

203
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,430
Just try to remember something, 
like when a girlfriend loved you.

204
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,390
Huh?!

205
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,610
S-S-Sorry! Right now, it's just that I—

206
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,650
Oh, right. You've never had a girlfriend.

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,880
Yuri, let's go somewhere today.

208
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,660
No, it's okay.

209
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,610
Yuri, let's go take a bath.

210
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,410
I'm going to sleep.

211
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,910
Yuri, let's go to sleep together.

212
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,670
I can't stand this guilt!

213
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,270
Good morning, Yuri.

214
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,930
Let's go to the ocean.

215
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,110
Okay...

216
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,650
Oh, seagulls.

217
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,490
Black-tailed gulls.

218
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,930
Ever since I came here,

219
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,750
I'm reminded of St. Petersburg when 
I hear seagulls in the early morning.

220
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,660
I never thought I'd leave that city,

221
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,640
so I never used to notice the seagulls' cries.

222
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,900
Do you ever have times like that?

223
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,820
There was a girl in Detroit who was really 
pushy and kept talking to me.

224
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,140
One time, a rink mate got into an accident.

225
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,310
I was pretty torn up with worry...

226
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,120
I was in the hospital waiting 
room with that girl.

227
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,960
When she hugged me to comfort me,

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,650
I shoved her away without thinking about it.

229
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,800
Wow, why?

230
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,660
I didn't want her to think 
I was feeling unsettled.

231
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,660
I felt like she was intruding on my 
feelings or something, and I hated it.

232
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,370
But then I realized that Minako-sensei, 
Nishigori, Yuko-chan, and my family

233
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,410
never treated me like a weakling.

234
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,750
They all had faith that I'd 
keep growing as a person,

235
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,710
and they never stepped over the line.

236
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,570
Yuri, you're not weak.

237
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,420
No one else thinks that, either.

238
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,440
What do you want me to be to you?

239
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
A father figure?

240
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,820
No.

241
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,620
A brother, then? A friend?

242
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,880
Then, your boyfriend, I guess.

243
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,930
I can try my best.

244
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,830
No, no, no, no, no!

245
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,200
I want you to stay who you are, Victor!

246
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,710
I've always looked up to you.

247
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,970
I ignored you because I didn't want 
you to see my shortcomings.

248
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,790
I'll make it up to you with my skating!

249
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,550
Okay, I won't let you off easy, then.

250
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,550
That's my way of showing my love.

251
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,230
<i>When I open up, he meets me where I am.</i>

252
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,080
<i>I shouldn't be afraid to open up more!</i>

253
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,650
She's going to redo the music.

254
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,960
Okay, I look forward to it.

255
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,130
Until she's done, um...

256
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,380
Please teach me all the jumps 
that you can do!

257
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,940
It's no good at all.

258
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,360
Even the king crab we ate yesterday 
had a better free leg than you.

259
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,020
Do it again, starting from the same place.

260
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,140
Your response?

261
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,960
Yes, ma'am!

262
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,240
<i>It might have been good that 
he left Victor's side early.</i>

263
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>He's trying to rebuild his strengths.</i>

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,870
Welcome, Victor!
Welcome Back, Katsuki Yuri

265
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,380
Victor, please let me do that one more time!

266
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,880
Wow... Hasn't it been tens 
of thousands of times?

267
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,790
Just thirteen.

268
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,290
I've thought this for a while, 
but you have pretty good stamina.

269
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,520
Well, I have that, at least.

270
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,770
You said you get hungry when you're 
nervous in competition, too.

271
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,230
You haven't suffered any major injuries, 
and you're younger than I am.

272
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
S-Sorry!

273
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,660
I couldn't help it!

274
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,820
Is it getting that thin?

275
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,900
No, no, no! Everything's okay!

276
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,220
I'm hurt... I can't recover from this.

277
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,790
Sorry!

278
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,090
Please get up!

279
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,910
Well, those two seem to get along fine.

280
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,060
It's here!

281
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,740
Victor, listen!

282
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,550
Oops, sorry!

283
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,010
The music for the free program's done.

284
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,020
If you want more impact,

285
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,270
maybe the last jump can 
be a quadruple toe loop?

286
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,170
Huh? For the last one?

287
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,780
With your stamina, I think you can pull it off.

288
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,690
You'd rather not?

289
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,360
I'll do it!

290
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,490
Okay.

291
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,140
Oh, right.

292
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,990
Yuri, did you change the musical theme?

293
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,640
Oh, um...

294
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,750
What is it?

295
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,250
The theme is "on my love."

296
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,760
That's the best theme.

297
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,720
Perfect.

298
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,160
Okay, let's finish this!

299
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,970
Yeah!

300
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,860
Kachu
Snack Bar

301
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,490
What?

302
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,500
The Grand Prix assignments were announced?!

303
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,960
Crap, crap, crap!

304
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,720
Do you three realize what time it is?!

305
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,990
Mom! The assignments!

306
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,750
Crap, crap!

307
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,960
Yuri!

308
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,960
The assignments are in.

309
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,060
Where?

310
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,390
Where'd the little Japanese 
piggy get assigned?

311
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,290
Congrats!

312
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,350
Congrats on Your Assignment in the GP Series, Yuri!

313
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,100
Thanks.

314
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,900
Okay, I'll explain which events 
you'll be competing in.

315
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,240
But first!

316
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,580
Since the Katsuki family still doesn't 
know much about figure skating,

317
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,560
we'll give a simple explanation!

318
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,010
Oh, that'd be very helpful.

319
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,400
Figure Skating Grand Prix Series

320
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,410
What is the Figure Skating Grand Prix series?

321
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,750
Skaters with high scores in the previous year

322
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,300
Czech Republic  Russia  China  South Korea

323
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Czech Republic  Russia  China  South Korea

324
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,970
Czech Republic  Russia  China  South Korea 
Switzerland  Italy  Russia  Thailand  USA 
Kazakhstan  Canada

325
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,680
First Event: Skate America

326
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,300
participate in a maximum of two 
competitions out of six worldwide.

327
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,910
Second Event: Skate Canada

328
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,430
Third Event: Cup of China

329
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,810
Fourth Event: NHK Trophy (Japan)

330
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,420
Only the top six skaters advance 
to the Grand Prix Final,

331
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,190
Fifth Event: Trophée de France

332
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,420
Sixth Event: Rostelecom Cup (Russia)

333
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,130
which decides who's number one!

334
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,130
Top 6 Male Figure Skaters

335
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,940
And this season, Yuri's been assigned to

336
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,890
Third Event: Cup of China!!

337
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,810
the third event, the Cup of China!

338
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,890
Phichit Chulanont

339
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,890
Yuri's former rink mate, Phichit 
from Thailand, will be there, too!

340
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,640
Oh, Phichit-kun!

341
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,480
And his second event will be...

342
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,650
Sixth Event: Rostelecom Cup (Russia)

343
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,370
The sixth event, Russia's Rostelecom Cup!

344
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,650
He'll be up against his fated rival, Yuri Plisetsky!

345
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,650
I'll kill you!

346
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,130
Yurio

347
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,510
Wow, Yurio! Davai, davai!

348
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,710
<i>So I'm already facing Yurio 
in the Rostelecom Cup...</i>

349
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,920
You'll be minding the house 
during the season, Maccachin.

350
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,910
<i>That's right...</i>

351
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,410
<i>It'll be my first time in a Grand Prix 
series without Victor in the lineup.</i>

352
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,980
I bet if you show up

353
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,820
with Victor as your coach, they'll think 
you stole him from the sport.

354
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,800
Maybe skating fans worldwide hate you now!

355
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,020
Sorry! We're on your side, Yuri-kun!

356
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,800
Yeah, we are.

357
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,180
I'll come cheer you on this season, too!

358
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,060
Yuri!!!

359
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,320
First up is the Cup of China!

360
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,880
Huh?

361
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,050
Yuri, last year...

362
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,060
In the Nationals...

363
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,240
I think I finished eleventh because 
I messed up my prep.

364
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,190
I see... So you have to compete 
in the block championships.

365
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,410
What?

366
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,780
Oh, we're talking about domestic competitions.

367
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,820
To explain, Yuri-kun had a big-time 
loss in last year's Nationals.

368
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Japanese National Championships!! 
Utter Defeat

369
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,840
Qualification Loss

370
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,110
So this year, he has to work his way 
up from qualifying competitions.

371
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,220
Must Compete in Qualifying Competitions

372
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,970
So his first event this season is the

373
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,460
Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional Championship

374
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,460
Chu-Shikoku-Kyushu Regional 
Championship in September.

375
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,290
It'll be his comeback competition!

376
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,160
Ow.

377
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,250
Well, you'll breeze through that.

378
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,080
Oh, but Minami-kun from Fukuoka 
will be competing in it!

379
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,530
Yeah, he beat Yuri in the Nationals.

380
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,900
Minami Kenjiro from Kyushu, said to be 
the #1 star among younger skaters!

381
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,940
Right...

382
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,190
<i>It's already been more than six months since 
December, when I thought I was done for.</i>

383
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,350
Good, good.

384
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,940
We can cheer you on this year, too!

385
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,690
Good luck.

386
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,440
Dad...

387
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,360
We need to use this chance to make money!

388
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,270
Dad.

389
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,910
You'll autograph a sign, won't you?

390
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,950
<i>Until now, I thought I was 
fighting all by myself.</i>

391
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,770
<i>But now that Victor's here, 
that's totally changed.</i>

392
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,370
<i>Some things are still the same.</i>

393
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,460
<i>Some have changed.</i>

394
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,340
<i>Now everything feels so new.</i>

395
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,730
<i>I may never be able to regain what I've lost,</i>

396
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,230
<i>but I can clearly see what's 
in front of me now.</i>

397
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,170
Okay, from the very beginning.

398
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,140
That's right, Yuri...

399
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,700
That's beautiful.

400
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,890
He was so reluctant at first,

401
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,800
but he's becoming more and 
more like a prima ballerina.

402
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,360
<i>I only have a short window 
before my body changes.</i>

403
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,490
<i>I'm going to take advantage of 
everything I can right now to win.</i>

404
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,560
<i>Figure skaters are only competitive 
for a short time.</i>

405
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,400
<i>This will probably be my last 
competitive figure skating season.</i>

406
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,920
<i>I don't know how long Victor will stick around</i>

407
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,220
<i>or how long my body will hold up.</i>

408
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,550
<i>So please, God...</i>

409
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,590
<i>Give me Victor's time, if only just for now.</i>

410
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,800
Yuri, you haven't named the 
piece. What will it be?

411
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,930
Yeah, perfect.

412
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,500
<i>September...</i>

413
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,930
<i>Victor's and my season will finally begin.</i>

414
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,860

It's my first official competition in a while.

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,710
I'm so nervous...

418
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,080
This is my coaching debut.

419
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,530
Yuri, what would you like me to wear?

420
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,030
Oh, just your usual clothes, please.

421
