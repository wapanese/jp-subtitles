Look!

00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,350
Yakov's team is here!

4
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,910
Meow

5
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,980
Yuratchka!

6
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,910
Yuri!

7
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,540
Mila, watch my luggage.

8
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,290
Huh?

9
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,530
Oh.

10
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,290
Coach Yakov, Yuri's disappeared.

11
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,270
Oh, yeah.

12
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,290
His family in Moscow's coming to pick him up.

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,300
<i>My name is Yuri Plisetsky.</i>

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,300
<i>In my senior debut, I'm aiming 
for number one in the world.</i>

15
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,550
<i>I'm the Ice Tiger of Russia.</i>

16
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,010
Oh, Yuri!

17
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,390
Grandpa!

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,640
Crack

19
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,790
S-Sorry, I forgot you had a bad back.

20
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,770
Yuri, I made my usual pirozhkis for you.

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,530
Grandpa, have you ever had a pork cutlet bowl?

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,970
Pork cutlet bowl?

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,670
I had them back in Japan.

24
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,780
They're really tasty!

25
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,000
Are the pirozhkis not very good?

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,330
No, that's not what I meant.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,760
<i>Our national hero, Victor Nikiforov, 
has returned to Russia as a coach</i>

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,190

32
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,460
How do you feel about returning to Russia?

33
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,890
When will you return to skating?

34
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,910
Until the Grand Prix Final is over,

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,900
I won't comment on any future plans.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,150
Right now, I see a lot of potential 
in Katsuki Yuri's skating.

37
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,400
I'd like you all to focus on Yuri 
at the Rostelecom Cup.

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
<i>I'm in it, too!</i>

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,090
If the skater Yuri has that much charisma,

40
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,310
don't you want to face him 
as a fellow competitor?

41
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,910
Hey, it's Yurio!

42
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,790
He's right.

43
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,420
It's Yuri Plisetsky!

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,790
Did you all see the short program 
I put together for Yurio?

45
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,930
Quit acting like you're still 
the top Russian figure skater.

46
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,160
I'm the star in this event!

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,930
<i>Oh, it's Seung Gil Lee from Korea.</i>

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,560
<i>Unlike the Cup of China, there's 
no one here I'm friendly with...</i>

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,120
If you want to date my little sister,

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,570
you'll have to beat me first!

51
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,090
Sorry, sorry.

52
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,610
Mickey!

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,160
Stop, we're just going out for a bite.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,080
Oh?

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,490
Sala's leagues above any other woman, idiot!

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,970
Hi, Yuri.

57
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,450
Hi, Seung Gil. Do you want to come with—

58
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:53,960
No.

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,750
Hey!

60
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,000
If you're turning a lady down, 
can't you be more considerate?

61
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,010
Do I get any benefit out of 
being friendly with you?

62
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,280
What?

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,390
Hey!

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,020
How dare you speak that way to Sala?!

65
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,280
Want a smackdown?!

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,250
Could you step aside?

67
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,850
Huh?!

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,880
Why are you sneaking around?

69
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,480
Yurio... Good to see you again.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,110
Um, good luck to both of us 
in the Rostelecom Cup.

71
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,240
Huh?

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
You'll suffer a miserable defeat here in Moscow.

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,620
I'm going to have Victor stay in Russia.

74
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,250
<i>Right...</i>

75
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,850
<i>If I can't rank higher than fourth in this event,</i>

76
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,120
<i>I won't make it to the Grand Prix Final.</i>

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,130
<i>And if I don't, what will Victor do?</i>

78
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,880

whether Thailand's Phichit Chulanont 
will advance to the Grand Prix Final.

126
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,150
Ugh, I'm getting disconnected 
from the livestream!

127
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,750
I should've gone to Russia.

128
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,520
You three, go to sleep already!

129
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
No!

130
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,560
I want to see it!

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,750
I want to see it live!

132
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,500
Group One's six-minute warm-up has ended.

133
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,510
Seung Gil, are you listening to me?

134
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,270
Everything you do is for Pyeongchang.

135
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,400
What you should be focused on right now is...

136
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,010
Seung Gil!

137
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,010
Seung Gil Lee of Korea, age 20.

138
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,470
In his first event, the NHK Trophy,

139
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,770
he drove the crowd wild by skating 
to this music, "Almavivo."

140
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,500
The first jump will be a quad.

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,370
So far in the world,

142
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,940
only Seung Gil Lee has landed 
this jump in competition.

143
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,180
A quadruple loop! Success!

144
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,990
The base value is 12.0.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,180
Seung Gil Lee's theme this season is "greed."

146
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,180
He said he'd like to approach

147
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,500
this season with a different masculine 
sex appeal than before.

148
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,330
His theme's similar to Yuri's.

149
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,800
Talk about sex appeal inflation.

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,910
Overflowing...

151
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,620
...masculine...

152
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,550
...sex appeal!

153
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,910
Even with the quadruple loop under his belt,

154
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,460
with the arsenal necessary to 
compete on the world stage,

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,760
Seung Gil still wants to break new ground

156
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,980
and personally requested to skate a mambo.

157
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,230
A triple axel.

158
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,680
Oh, he fell!

159
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,180
<i>I had enough rotation.</i>

160
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,570
<i>The jump was in the second half,</i>

161
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,680
<i>so I get a 1.1 multiplier,</i>

162
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,860
<i>which means a 9.35 with a deduction of 1.</i>

163
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,480
A triple Lutz, triple toe loop.

164
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,900
No mistakes there!

165
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,560
<i>With a 1.1 multiplier, that got me 11.11 points.</i>

166
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,290
<i>Now the final element, a step sequence...</i>

167
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,630
What a passionate step sequence!

168
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,130
His polished execution should be 
well-received by the judges.

169
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,430
His face is expressionless, 
but his steps are out of this world.

170
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,720
He's evolved even further since the NHK Trophy!

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,690
Wow!

172
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,720
That's a hard act to follow...

173
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,640
Yeah, right.

174
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,660
That was hot!

175
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,700
I've never seen you nervous.

Next up is Emil Nekola of
the Czech Republic, age 18.

182

Cheers from the crowd never 
affect my performance.

183
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,280
He sure can jump,

184
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,900
but if his performance is lackluster...

185
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,890
Is it?

186
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,390

Did you all hear that?

189
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,340
Emil landed a quadruple loop, too.

190
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,590
Applause!

191
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,360
Huh?

192
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,320
Oh, sorry. I didn't catch that.

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,700
Victor did the same jump 
at last year's exhibition.

194
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,250
I want to see that again!

195
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,250

Sala!

204
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,840
His sister, Sala, is also here for support.

205
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,380
He will skate to "L'Homme Armé" from 
the movie <i>Destiny of Knights</i>.

206

<i>See my chivalry, Sala!</i>

Mickey!

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,450
<i>I've defeated every single man who's 
tried to approach Sala so far.</i>

A quadruple Salchow.

213
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,590
Ah, he fell.

214
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,180
<i>Sala...</i>

215
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,250
<i>I don't want you feeling down because of me</i>

<i>can protect Sala as a lady!</i>

221
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,360
The next jump combination is 
a triple Lutz, triple toe loop.

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,860
<i>Oh, no way...</i>

223

The combination turned into 
a triple Lutz, triple loop!

224
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,990
That combination has a very high difficulty.

225
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,000
Among active skaters, only his sister,

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,270
Sala Crispino, attempts this combination.

227
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,670

You're right.

255
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,780
Don't worry.

256
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,840

257

He's skating to "On Love: Eros."

262
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,630
He's been beating his short program personal 
bests since the first event in the series.

263
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,550
He'll need to finish fourth or higher

264
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,050

265
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,770
<i>If I lose at the Rostelecom Cup,</i>

<i>I guess Yuri is more motivated</i>

272
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,520
<i>when he's competing away, 
where expectations are lower.</i>

273
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,320
<i>At any rate, he's in his best form so far.</i>

274
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,180
His first planned jump is a triple

All the work you did in practice

He's skating to "On Love: Agape,"

322
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,160
a different arrangement of the 
music used in Katsuki's program,

323
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,430
with an opposing theme.

324
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,300

332
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,990
His position is quite beautiful.

333
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,540
<i>I've been pouring blood, sweat, 
and tears into this</i>

334
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,130
<i>since that humiliation, too.</i>

335
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,370
<i>I just lack overall experience, that's all.</i>

336
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,130
The first quad comes in a combination.

337
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,530
A quadruple Salchow, triple toe loop.

338
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,920
A fantastic jump combination 
with great height and flow!

339

With such polish,

340
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,030
it's hard to believe he only started 
doing that this season.

341
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,910
And here comes the final jump.

342
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,370

<i>Even when he wasn't at his best, 
he always analyzed his performance</i>

346
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,550
<i>mid-program to make a strong comeback.</i>

347
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,740
<i>That's right.</i>

348
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,400
<i>Have pride in yourself as a work 
of art until the very end, Yuri.</i>

349

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,400
to the local supporters' high 
expectations here in Moscow!

352
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,000
So cute!

353
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,290
Oh, ladies first.

354
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,300
<i>I forgot there was someone even 
more annoying than those two.</i>

355
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,220
<i>JJ!</i>

356
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,090
The score's up.

Yuri Plisetsky's score is 98.09,

359
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,590
Katsuki Yuri remains in first place.

360
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,980
The last competitor is the skater with 
the most momentum right now,

361
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,500
Jean-Jacques Leroy of Canada, age 19.

362
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,360
He's known as "JJ."

363
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,110
He will skate to an original 
song composed for him,

364
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,490
"Theme of King JJ."

365
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,780
<i>I'm the only one in the whole 
wide world who can pull off</i>

366
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,770
<i>a dream collaboration with 
a world-famous rock band!</i>

367
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,760
A quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop.

368
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,980
He's doing mega-jumps right off the bat!

369
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,720
He placed third in last year's Grand Prix Final.

370
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
This season, he has won Skate Canada,

371
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,100
and currently has the greatest momentum.

372
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,050
<i>Watch me do another big one!</i>

373
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,380
A triple axel.

374
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,460
That was another mega-high jump 
that almost cleared the fence!

375
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,280
<i>You might expect a top skater</i>

376
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,780
<i>to plan a lot of jumps for the 
second half of their program,</i>

377
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,780
<i>but I'm different.</i>

378
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,220
<i>Because I value the collaboration 
between my skating and the music!</i>

379
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,790
<i>It's JJ style!</i>

380
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,560
<i>Let's go! Everyone sing along!</i>

381
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,760
The lyrics express how JJ is at the top of the 
world and invite everyone to follow him.

382
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,780
What an impressive step sequence.

383
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,290
Now, the last jump is a mega-jump that

384
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,320
not even Victor Nikiforov ever 
attempted in the second half,

385
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,290
a quadruple Lutz.

386
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,680
He did it!

387
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,500
<i>No one else takes such risks, right?</i>

388
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,450
<i>I get them done because...</i>

389
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,300
<i>Right, because I'm the king!</i>

390
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,100
<i>I never stand still.</i>

391
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,740
<i>Or rather, I can't stand still!</i>

392
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,330
Huh?

393
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,900
JJ!

394
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,580
It's JJ Style!

395
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,580
Oh, Yuri?

396
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,690
Veterinary Hospital

397
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,620
Sorry to bother you during an event,

398
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,340
but Maccachin stole some buns, 
and they got stuck in his throat.

399
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,590
We're at the vet right now,

400
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,840
but we're not sure he'll make it.

He's surpassed his personal 
best Skate Canada score!

405
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,350
Sorry, what do you want us to do?

406
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,590
Victor!

407
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,610
Go back to Japan right now.

408
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,240
I'll face the free skate tomorrow on my own!

409
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,170
Don't eat too many pirozhkis tomorrow, okay?

410
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,540
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,700
Huh?

412
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,870
But you have to go back!

413
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,120
Like I said, I can't.

414
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,450
What's going on with them?

415
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,140
Yakov!

416
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,150
Thank God!

417
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,820
You're the only coach for me.

418
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,810
What?

419
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,310
You want to come back?

420
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,470
Can you be Yuri's coach tomorrow, 
for just one day?

421
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,470
Huh?

422
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,470
Huh?

423
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,470
Huh?

424
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,980
Huh?!

425
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,980
To Be Continued!!!

426
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Whine...

427
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,700
My dear Yuratchka, eat some pirozhkis.

428
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,620
I'd like some, too.

429
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,290
I have no pirozhkis for you!

430
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,620
You don't seem to have changed.
