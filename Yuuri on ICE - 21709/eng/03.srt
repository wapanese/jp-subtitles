00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,700
<i>Hello!</i>

2
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,590
<i>I'm Katsuki Yuri.</i>

3
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,490
<i>Now that the Russian Punk, Yurio,</i>

4
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,180
<i>has come in pursuit of my coach, 
Victor, all hell's broken loose.</i>

5
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,330
<i>The Hot Springs on Ice event is now being 
held so that Yurio and I can face off!</i>

6
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,330
Hasetsu Exhibition 
Hot Springs on Ice 
Presented by Victor Nikiforov

7
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,580
<i>If Yurio wins, Victor will go back 
to Russia and be Yurio's coach.</i>

8
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,960
<i>If I win, Victor will stay in 
Japan and be my coach.</i>

9
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,970
<i>So I'm gonna give it all the eros I've got!</i>

10
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,970
Third Skate 
I Am Eros, and Eros Is Me?! 
Face-Off! Hot Springs on Ice

11
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,790
I Am Eros, and Eros Is Me?!

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,970
Face-off! Hot Springs on Ice.

13
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,480
<i>First, Yurio's "On Love: Agape."</i>

14
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,570
<i>Agape... Unconditional love.</i>

15
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,640
<i>God's infinite love is 
self-sacrificing and uncalculating.</i>

16
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,250
<i>Crap, this is hard.</i>

17
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,260
<i>Victor can pull it off,</i>

18
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,260
<i>but I wonder how Yurio will do it.</i>

19
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,890
Kind of like that. What do you think?

20
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,890
Yeah, I pretty much got it.

21
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,570
Huh?!

22
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,400
Wow... That was amazing.

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,650
Hey, who's that chick?

24
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,650
Oh, she's one of the staff here, Yuko-san.

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,380
Sorry for interrupting your practice.

26
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,680
It was so wonderful, I couldn't help myself.

27
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,790
Okay, Yuri. You're next.

28
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,580
Let's go!

29
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,410
O-Okay.

30
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,420
<i>Choreography that Victor did for me alone...</i>

31
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,630
<i>"On Love: Eros."</i>

32
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,430
Spurt

33
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,840
<i>Eros... Sexual love.</i>

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,310
<i>Pleasure followed by pleasure.</i>

35
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,170
<i>One just drowns in it.</i>

36
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,850
<i>D-Damn, he's so hot!</i>

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,450
What the... Are you sick?

38
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,900
<i>It's enough to make even me, 
a man, pregnant! Such eros!</i>

39
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,360
<i>Huh?</i>

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,670
<i>Can I skate this?</i>

41
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,240
Yuri!

42
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,900
How was that?

43
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,620
Oh, um...

44
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,430
It was very "eros"!

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,360
Right?

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,120
So, about the program composition... 
Which quads can you land?

47
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,040
The toe loop, and...

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,460
I can land the Salchow in practice, 
but never in competition.

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,470
Um, I think I can do it if I try!

50
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,200
So, um...

51
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,510
Okay, you can practice the basics.

52
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,890
I'll teach Yurio first.

53
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,890
I won't teach you anything 
you can't do right now.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,150
How many times have you messed 
up during a competition?

55
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,530
You have the skill to win.
Why can't you make it happen?

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Well, that's probably because...

57
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,280
I lack confidence.

58
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,870
Right. My job is to make you 
feel confident in yourself.

59
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,640
No one in the whole wide world 
knows your true eros, Yuri.

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,840
It may be an alluring side of you 
that you yourself are unaware of.

61
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,340
Can you show me what it is soon?

62
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,090
Hey, Victor! Aren't you teaching me first?!

63
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,550
Right.

64
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,600
So, Yuri.

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,480
Think long and hard about 
what eros is to you.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,730
<i>What eros is to me? What would that be?</i>

67
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,980
Hot Springs on Ice 
Yuri vs. Yurio 
Hasetsu Exhibition!!

68
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,990
Who knew we'd get a lineup like this in Hasetsu?

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,160
Lots of people will come!

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,740
Well, either way...

71
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,870
Yuri's back! Cheers!

72
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,990
Cheers!

73
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,440
Huh?

74
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,520
You had to do basic training for half 
a day because you didn't get "eros"?

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,250
Yeah.

76
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,300
You should have just made something up.

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,750
I bet Victor hasn't thought 
much about it, either.

78
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,260
Victor's a genius, so he can get away with that.

79
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,260
I could see a story in the program, too.

80
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,440
A playboy comes to a certain town

81
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,060
and bewitches the women left and right.

82
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,180
He decides to pursue the most 
beautiful woman in town,

83
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,570
but she isn't swayed.

84
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,570
Then, as they play the game of love,

85
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,070
she finds it difficult to make the right choices

86
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,310
and ends up falling for him.

87
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,600
Then he casts her aside, 
as though he's tired of her,

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,110
and goes off to the next town.

89
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,290
"Wow! So hot! Take me!"

90
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,710
That doesn't really sound like you, Yuri.

91
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,550
Right?

92
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,420
I bet people will say they'd prefer 
to see Victor skate the program.

93
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,050
But you looked pretty sexy in the video 
when you copied his program.

94
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,060
Well, I can't copy him.

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,430
I'll never surpass him by doing that.

96
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,370
Wait, you seriously think you can 
be better than him someday?

97
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:19,970
Huh?

98
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh, um, no, not at all!

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,950
I mean, how can someone as
inexperienced in dating as you

100
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,260
beat the hottest bachelor in the world?

101
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,950
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,020
Stop, stop!

103
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,200
Hmm, something isn't right here.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm doing it like you showed me, aren't I?

105
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,580
The way you currently are,

106
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,540
your greed is too obvious.

107
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,040
There's no sense of agape, unconditional 
love, in your performance.

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,270
It's good to have confidence,

109
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,840
but this program isn't where 
you should show it off.

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,990
Huh?

111
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,350
You're the one who's skated with 
complete confidence this whole time!

112
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,350
Well, what's agape to you, then, Victor?!

113
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,600
It's a feeling, of course,

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,640
so I could never explain it in words.

115
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,110
Do you bother thinking about 
that when you skate?

116
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,860
You're funny, Yurio.

117
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,610
Well, maybe we need a temple.

118
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,620
A temple?

119
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,620
Ow!

120
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,130
<i>Damn it.</i>

121
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,960
<i>I'm an adult male of twenty-three.</i>

122
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,260
<i>I could totally show mature 
sexiness if I wanted to.</i>

123
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,080
Hey, hey!

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,510
Take a photo of me in the bath 
so I can post it online.

125
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,460
Sorry, but we don't let people 
take photos in the bath.

126
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,390
Really?

127
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,690
<i>It's no good...</i>

128
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,520
<i>From a physical standpoint, 
I'm not even close to eros.</i>

129
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,180
<i>Eros, eros...</i>

130
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,040
<i>It's what causes you to lose the 
ability to make normal decisions.</i>

131
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,280
<i>For me, what causes me to 
lose that ability is...</i>

132
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,740
I get it now!

133
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,570
Pork cutlet bowls!

134
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,910
That's what eros is to me!

135
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,670
Silence...

136
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,950
Oh, sorry.

137
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,170
It's not...

138
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,920
Okay, let's go with that.

139
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,760
It's nice and unique.

140
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,040
Seriously?

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,320
Man, I'm so embarrassed!

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,980
They totally think my ideas 
are way too immature!

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,670
Yuri!

144
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,880
Try to imagine entangling more of the egg.

145
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,240
Think of the pork cutlet bowl!

146
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,110
Got it!

147
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,630
Next, Yurio!

148
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:43,870
Maybe the temple.

149
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,580
Just tell me if I'm not up to par!

150
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,760
Your free leg's sloppy!

151
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,490
Keep it up!

152
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,320
Put your back into it!

153
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,950
All right...

154
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,080
Hmm...

155
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,830
Well, maybe a waterfall would help.

156
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,830
A waterfall?!

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,620
I'm gonna kill him.

158
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,890
Why me, too?

159
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,880
Who cares?

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,340
Damn it.

161
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,160
Who cares about agape?

162
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,670
Forget all of them.

163
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,470
Yuratchka...

164
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,000
You were the best of the bunch.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,760
Grandpa, can you come to 
practice again tomorrow?

166
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
I can skate even better!

167
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm fine, even if Mom's not there!

168
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,290
Yurio?

169
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,330
Hey, Yurio!

170
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,240
Are you okay?

171
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,750
Let's call it a day.

172
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,750
Oh... Okay.

173
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,270
<i>What's going on?</i>

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,150
<i>Why did he suddenly look so vulnerable?</i>

175
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,460
Ugh... Where's Victor, anyway?

176
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,410
He went to eat at Nagahama Ramen, I guess.

177
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,090
What?

178
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,170
We're going there, too!

179
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,040
Huh?

180
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,890
Nagahama Ramen

181
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,890
Vkusno!

182
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,400
Hasetsu Exhibition 
"Hot Springs On Ice" in 1 Day

183
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,000
Victor still isn't here, huh?

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,150
They said he was drinking until dawn.

185
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,900
Dumbass.

186
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh, Yurio...

187
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,340
Huh?

188
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,940
What?

189
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,330
Please teach me how to land a quad Salchow.

190
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,540
Please!

191
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,390
You suck!

192
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,120
Hey, Pork Cutlet Bowl. 
Watch me do it one more time.

193
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,340
Sorry I'm late!

194
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,460
Huh?

195
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,880
What were you practicing just now?

196
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,090
I'm gonna check my choreography.

197
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,310
<i>Agape...</i>

198
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,830
<i>Unconditional love.</i>

199
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,940
<i>To me, that means Grandpa.</i>

200
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,960
Looks like Yurio found his agape.

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,070
Maybe he's ready for the next stage.

202
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,310
<i>Huh? Next stage?</i>

203
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,330
<i>Does that mean I have a next stage, once 
I perform the eros of the pork cutlet bowl?</i>

204
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,980
<i>I still can't find it, though.</i>

205
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,340
<i>I still lack what would serve as 
the backbone this program needs.</i>

206
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,680
Hasetsu Hot Springs 
Yu-topia Katsuki

207
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,890
So, what will you do for a costume tomorrow?

208
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,650
Oh! I totally forgot!

209
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,390
I didn't bring anything, either.

210
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,980
That's taken care of!

211
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,190
I had them send all the costumes I've ever 
worn in competition from Russia!

212
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,970
Wow!

213
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,130
There are lots of stupid-looking ones.

214
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,180
Hey, you wore this one at the 
Grand Prix Final last year!

215
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,150
Hey! Don't pick anything flashier than mine!

216
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,790
This is from the Junior World Championship!

217
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,550
Oh, yeah.

218
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,310
I had long hair at the time,

219
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,100
so my costume suggested both 
male and female genders at once.

220
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,310
<i>Oh, that's right...</i>

221
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,580
I choose this one!

222
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,340
Oh, come on! Who is it?

223
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,380
Huh?

224
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,590
You want to practice in my 
studio this late at night?

225
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,180
Minako-sensei, I need you 
to teach me something.

226
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,230
We're here at Ice Castle Hasetsu, venue of 
the Hasetsu Exhibition: Hot Springs on Ice.

227
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,610
Right off the bat,

228
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,240
Hasetsu Exhibition: Hot Springs on Ice

229
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,240
we have skaters Katsuki Yuri and Yuri Plisetsky.

230
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Both your new short programs were 
choreographed by Victor Nikiforov.

231
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,890
You'll be presenting them today in competition.

232
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,750
Tell us how you feel going into the event!

233
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,200
Um, it'd be great if you'd try 
the hot springs afterward.

234
00:12:52,750 --> 00:13:13,890
Hasetsu Exhibition: Hot Springs on Ice

235
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,070
Hey! We're not asking you to promote tourism!

236
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,280
Promote yourself!

237
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,340
We don't need two Yuris. I'll crush him.

238
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,480
Yes, that's it! Thanks for giving 
us what we wanted to hear!

239
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,890
Spasibo, spasibo.

240
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,110
Last but not least, let's hear 
from Victor Nikiforov,

241
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,310
who's switched to coaching out of the blue!

242
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,890
Hasetsu Tourism Ambassador

243
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,090
Hi!

244
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,880
Hasetsu is a great place. 
 Come and visit at least once!

245
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,710
What are you doing, Victor?

246
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,220
Huh?

247
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,270
Stop that! It makes today's 
face-off look cheap!

248
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,400
You'd better be ready to evaluate our battle!

249
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,280
You'll grant the wish of whichever 
one of us wins, right?

250
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,180
Oh...

251
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,850
Of course!

252
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,530
You forgot, didn't you?

253
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:37,040
Thank you for coming to the Hasetsu 
Exhibition: Hot Springs on Ice,

254
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,010
Wow, this is amazing.

255
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,040
How many years has it been since 
so many people were in this rink?

256
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,710
presented by Victor Nikiforov.

257
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,720
Yurio-kun!

258
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,340
It's almost time.

259
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,350
Okay.

260
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,940
It's the see-through costume of legend 
from Victor's junior days!

261
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,750
I never thought I'd see it in 
person! It's so beautiful...

262
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,690
You're gushing all kinds of fluids again.

263
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,940
You look really good in it! Good luck!

264
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,610
O-Okay.

265
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh, you have to go.

266
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,990
Come on, get a move on!

267
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,250
Now, a champion with wins in the Junior Grand 
Prix Final and Junior World Championship.

268
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,210
Hoping for a

269
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,340
brilliant senior division debut, with programs 
choreographed by Victor Nikiforov,

270
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,420
Yuri Plisetsky!

271
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,170
Davai!

272
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,440
Yuri, davai!

273
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,110
Davai!

274
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,390
Yuri, davai!

275
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,110
He will be skating to "On Love: Agape."

276
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,000
His first jump is a triple axel.

277
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,580
Excellent.

278
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,500
<i>Everyone's drawn into Yurio's agape performance.</i>

279
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,840
<i>I can tell it's completely different 
from what I saw in practice.</i>

280
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,850
<i>That's when Yurio's performance changed.</i>

281
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,550
<i>No one can look away from this 
beautiful, ever-evolving monster!</i>

282
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,840
We're approaching the quadruples he was 
prohibited from performing in competition.

283
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,110
Not to mention they're in the 
second half of his program.

284
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,220
A quadruple Salchow, 
followed by a triple toe loop!

285
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
He unveiled the quad with a flourish!

286
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,410
Here comes his final jump, 
a quadruple toe loop!

287
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,700
He nailed it!

288
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,460
What an astonishing fifteen-year-old!

289
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,070
He nailed all of his jumps!

290
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,140
<i>Sorry, Grandpa.</i>

291
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,860
<i>I'm too busy trying to skate the program</i>

292
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,730
<i>to really think about agape at all!</i>

293
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,860
The last element is his signature move, 
the combination spin.

294
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,860
<i>Damn it...</i>

295
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,410
<i>Just end already!</i>

296
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,480
Amazing! A masterful performance!

297
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,800
There's a lot to look forward 
to this coming season!

298
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,210
<i>I'm better than this!</i>

299
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,220
Yurio!

300
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,220
That was the best performance 
I've seen from you so far!

301
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,860
Go on, greet the audience!

302
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,500
Yuri Plisetsky, who's enthralled the audience!

303
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,630
<i>That was amazing.</i>

304
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,460
<i>He'll definitely rank among the 
top senior division skaters.</i>

305
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,220
<i>Right...</i>

306
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,020
<i>If I lose, Victor will go back to Russia.</i>

307
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,530
<i>I don't want that.</i>

308
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,900
<i>I have to win.</i>

309
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,290
<i>I want to win.</i>

310
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,270
<i>I want to win!</i>

311
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,100
Yuri.

312
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,290
It's your turn.

313
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
U-Um, I'm...

314
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,250
I'm going to become a super
tasty pork cutlet bowl,

315
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,800
so please watch me!

316
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,720
Promise!

317
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,490
Of course.

318
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,470
I love pork cutlet bowls.

319
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,830
We're pleased to introduce a skater 
who represents Japan,

320
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,980
a late bloomer who's become a rising star,

321
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,960
Katsuki Yuri!

322
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,370
Good luck, Yuri-kun!

323
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,080
He will skate to "On Love: Eros."

324
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Yuri!

325
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,530
Good luck, Katsuki-kun!

326
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,470
He's been having difficulty expressing "eros,"

327
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,390
but he said he'll think of how he'd 
love to eat his favorite dish,

328
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,490
the pork cutlet bowl.

329
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,750
<i>I pulled an all-nighter to help him practice,</i>

330
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,770
<i>and he's no ordinary pork cutlet bowl.</i>

331
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,010
<i>Who am I dancing for?</i>

332
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,970
<i>I know who.</i>

333
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,170
What a seductive step sequence!

334
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,720
It's hard to believe he's
imagining a pork cutlet bowl!

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
<i>Good!</i>

336
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,180
<i>You're known for your step sequences and spins.</i>

337
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,180
I want you to teach me how 
to move in feminine ways.

338
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,490
Huh?

339
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,340
Trying to be the playboy isn't me.

340
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,690
I want to be the most beautiful woman 
in town, who seduces the playboy!

341
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,270
I won't drastically change any moves,

342
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,700
but I think this is a lot closer to how I feel.

343
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,030
<i>At first, I wasn't sure what he 
was being all serious about,</i>

344
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,270
<i>but his performance has 
integrated his emotions.</i>

345
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,230
<i>It's changed.</i>

346
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,630
Now, we have a spread eagle into a triple axel.

347
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,760
<i>Man, this program is tough.</i>

348
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,020
<i>Scheduling all the jumps in the second 
half just because he has stamina</i>

349
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,920
<i>is pretty spartan.</i>

350
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,380
Oops! He stepped out of 
his quadruple Salchow!

351
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,000
He managed to stay on his feet 
by putting his hand down.

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,140
<i>About what you'd expect.</i>

353
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,730
<i>Don't panic!</i>

354
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,320
<i>A mistake like this isn't enough 
to make me lose my charms.</i>

355
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,360
<i>I'm better than any other woman out there.</i>

356
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,530
<i>You ask why?</i>

357
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,410
A quadruple toe loop, 
followed by a triple toe loop!

358
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,620
He nailed it!

359
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,130
<i>A quad-triple combination 
at the very end? Is he insane?</i>

360
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,530
<i>He nailed it, too.</i>

361
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,430
Welcome back, Yuri!

362
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,940
Welcome back!

363
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,400
Guys, it's not "welcome back."

364
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,920
That was a Yuri you've never seen before.

365
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,440
No one could look away.

366
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,940
I'm looking forward to this season now.

367
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,440
Yuri!

368
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,340
That was the tastiest pork 
cutlet bowl I've ever seen!

369
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,420
Wonderful!

370
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,360
Th-Thank you.

371
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,200
But can I say something?

372
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,710
S-Sure.

373
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,120
What was with your triple axel 
out of the spread eagle?

374
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,300
That was the worst attempt so far.

375
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,420
I know you had Yurio teach you the quad 
Salchow in secret, but what was that?

376
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,630
Huh? Yuri?

377
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,470
Yurio-kun, hang on.

378
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,430
You're going back without even 
hearing the results?

379
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,810
I already know the results.

380
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,060
<i>That performance...</i>

381
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm going to keep going under Yakov.

382
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,020
Later.

383
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,190
Dasvidaniya.

384
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,940
I see.

385
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,890
Don't get me wrong!

386
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm the one who'll win at 
the Grand Prix Final!

387
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,820
Tell him that!

388
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,700
Katsuki Yuri has won the 
Hot Springs on Ice event.

389
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,380
A word, please.

390
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,710
O-Oh, um...

391
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,030
I'm going to try and win the next 
Grand Prix Final with Victor!

392
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,820
Thank you for your continued support!

393
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,140
<i>The battle for my very last 
figure skating season has begun.</i>

394
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,020
To Be Continued!!!

395
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,240
Who'd even be happy to see me naked on ice?

396
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,740
At the very least, I would be.

397
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,220
Huh?
