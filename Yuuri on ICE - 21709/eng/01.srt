2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,950
<i>Ever since I first saw his skating,</i>

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>it's been an unending chain of surprises.</i>

Sochi Grand Prix Final

5
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,450
He's also crushed the free skating event!

6
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,760
It will be the fifth consecutive Grand 
Prix Final victory for Russia's legend,

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Victor Nikiforov.

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,940
Nikiforov is now 27 years old.

9
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,340
Some speculated that he 
might retire this season,

10
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,150
but his masterful performance seems 
to lay such rumors to rest.

11
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,960
As for Katsuki Yuri, who earned a spot 
in the Grand Prix for the first time,

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,470
what do you think, Honda-san?

13
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,660
Well, he didn't perform like 
his usual self today.

16
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,070
Yuri, don't look at the news.

17
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,140
Let's go back.

Is This Season His Last?"

19
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,530
Yuri...

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,440

<i>My name makes me sound strong,</i>

25
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,240
<i>but I finished last at my first Grand Prix Final.</i>

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,260
<i>I still can't accept what happened!</i>

27
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,260
Last Place

28
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,440
<i>I even moved to a training facility in Detroit</i>

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,560
<i>and worked hard to make it to the final.</i>

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,170
<i>But the pressure had me binge-eating before 
the match, and our family dog died...</i>

31
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,570
<i>Mentally and physically, I was at my worst!</i>

32
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,070
<i>It was supposed to be my big day, too...</i>

33
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,820
<i>Well, it's all my fault, anyway.</i>

34
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,570
Hello?

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,700
Mom, were you sleeping?

36
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,200
Sorry.

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,610
Oh, you were watching on TV?

38
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,330
Huh? A public viewing?

39
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,950
Please! I'm so embarrassed!

40
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,740
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,860
I messed up.

42
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,450
Sorry.

<i>What the hell?!</i>

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,340
Hey.

49
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,970
I'm competing in the senior division next year.

50
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,840
We don't need two Yuris in the same bracket.

51
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,220
Incompetents like you should 
just retire already.

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,170
Moron!

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,940
<i>Even if I left the sport,</i>

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,490
<i>there'd be tons of talented young 
skaters rising through the ranks.</i>

55
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,120
Katsuki-kun!

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,810

57
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,660
Don't give up!

58
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,000
It's too early for you to retire!

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,630
It's not like I've made a decision. 
Please don't make assumptions.

60
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,260
What will you do after you 
graduate from college?

61
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,930
Uh...

62
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,530
Will you still train in Detroit?

63
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,160
I'll be talking that over with Coach Celestino.

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,010
Katsuki-kun!

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,510
I'm asking how <i>you</i> feel about this!

66
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>I don't want to think right now.</i>

67
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,470
Will you keep going?

68
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,020
<i>I'm sorry, Vicchan.</i>

69
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,710
Maybe just part-time?

70
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,020
You'll still have a chance back in Japan.

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,450
<i>Sorry I can't go home.</i>

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,030
Yuri.

73
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,260
About your free performance,

74
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,960
the step sequence could use more—

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,030
I won, so who cares?

76
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,250
Quit nagging, Victor.

77
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,030
<i>Oh, the Yuri on the Russian team...</i>

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,450
Hey, Yuri!

79
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,290
<i>If I do have a chance, someday I'd like to...</i>

80
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,290
You can't talk that way forever!

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,910
A commemorative photo?

82
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,080
Sure.

83
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,700
Katsuki-kun?

84
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,210
You don't want a photo with Victor?

85
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,440
Yuri!

86
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,590
<i>This is humiliating.</i>

87
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,680

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,380
Isn't that Yuri?

108
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,770
Yeah, it's him.

109
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,550
I haven't heard any news about him 
lately. What's he been up to?

110
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,410
Remember he lost a big competition last year?

111
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,730
Was it the Nationals?

150
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,300

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,100
Thanks.

177
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm sorry it's been five years...

178
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,260
It's all good!

179
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,100
I'm sorry I couldn't make it 
to your graduation, too.

180
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,240
Want a pork cutlet bowl?

181
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,650
Huh? Did you lose weight, Hiroko?

182
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,870
Nope!

183
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,750
Minako-senpai, you always look 
the same, even though you drink!

184
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,930
Yuri, I've been wondering ever 
since I saw you at the station...

185
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,250
What's with that gut?

186
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,760
Uh...

187
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,880
Take your clothes off!

188
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,380
No, no! Minako-sensei!

189
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,880
Nooooo!!

190
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,620
Wow, you look just like your mom.

191
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,340
Dad...

192
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,250
Toshio-san! It's no laughing matter!

193
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,940
This is not the weight a 
figure skater should have!

194
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,430
You always did gain weight easily.

195
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,650
But what can you do?

196
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,650
Yu-topia Katsuki Specialty Dish 
Yuri's Pork Cutlet Bowl

197
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,650
Eat lots of pork cutlet bowls tonight!

198
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,150
Uh, before that...

199
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,860
Oh, right.

200
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,530
Go say hi to Vicchan.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,010
<i>Sorry I couldn't see you one last time, Vicchan.</i>

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,410
Yuri, welcome back.

203
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,670
Mari-neechan...

204
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,200
It's been a while.

205
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,810
Sorry to visit when things are busy.

206
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,340
Hey, how long are you staying in Hasetsu?

207
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,930
Will you help out with the hot spring?

208
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,800
Huh? Where's this coming from?

209
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,410
You went to college, even though 
you had to study an extra year.

210
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,560
What will you do now?

211
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,560
If you're going to keep skating, 
I'll support you, but...

212
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,250
I think... I need more time to think it over.

213
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,570
Hmm, okay.

214
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,320
Well, go soak in the hot spring and relax.

215
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,570
<i>I was born and raised in Hasetsu, Kyushu,</i>

216
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,080
<i>a castle town by the sea.</i>

217
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,590
<i>The "castle" has no historical basis and 
is a facade with a ninja house inside.</i>

218
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,910
<i>Its sole source of tourism income was its 
hot spring inns, but most went under.</i>

219
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,090
<i>My family's Yu-topia Katsuki 
is the last one standing.</i>

220
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,100
Man, our hot spring sure hits the spot...

221
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,850
Do Not Change Channel

222
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,330
<i>Group 2 has now finished skating,</i>

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,630
Man, I really wanted to go.

224
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,630
<i>and Emil Nekola from the 
Czech Republic is in first.</i>

225
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,690
If only you'd been in it, Yuri.

226
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,690
<i>His free program performance, 
befitting the season finale,</i>

227
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,310
You could've told me the 
skaters' hotel room numbers.

228
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,310
<i>was free of mistakes, 
earning him a personal best.</i>

229
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,790
I wouldn't tell you!

230
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,560
<i>The last group has just entered the arena.</i>

231
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,240
You expect me to be your one-man ticket 
agency to score you tickets, don't you?

232
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,240
<i>All eyes are on Victor Nikiforov,</i>

233
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,990
That's not true! I've been supporting you!

234
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,990
<i>who's going for his fifth consecutive 
World Championship gold.</i>

235
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,490
Victor Nikiforov, Age 27 
Winner of Four Consecutive World Figure Skating Championships

236
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,620
<i>He will be skating last.</i>

237
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,060
<i>Well, Honda-san, this is certainly 
unexplored territory!</i>

238
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,280
<i>It'll really be interesting to 
see how far he can go.</i>

239
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,280
What about soccer?

240
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,450
Sagan Tosu's having a match right now.

241
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,910
<i>When you watch Victor...</i>

242
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,030
Hey! I was watching skating first!

243
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,800
Sagan Tosu?

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,750
Aren't you supposed to be working?

245
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,980
Oh, where are you going, Yuri?

246
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
Sorry. I'm going to practice for a bit.

247
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,420
Take care!

248
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,990
Excuse me.

249
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,630
Our regular hours are over.

250
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,880
It's been a while, Yuko-san.

251
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,660
Yuri-kun?

252
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,710
Oh, come on!

253
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,490
Call me "Yu-chan"!

254
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,380
S-Sorry.

255
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,720
Oh, you came to skate, right?

256
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,540
Go ahead.

257
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,890
Huh? I can?

258
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,390
You just want to skate alone for now, right?

259
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll protect you.

260
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,890
Thanks.

261
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,520
<i>Yu-chan was my rink mate 
and two years my senior.</i>

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,450
<i>When we were little, 
she was really good at skating.</i>

263
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,370
<i>She was my idol,</i>

264
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,660
<i>the Madonna of Ice Castle Hasetsu.</i>

265
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,410
<i>She's still cute, too.</i>

266
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,540
Ta-da!

267
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,670
Wow, Yuri-kun!

268
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,710
Stay out of my way, fatso!

269
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,360
Takeshi-kun, don't be mean to the new kid!

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,900
Fatso! Fatso!

271
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,200
Hey!

272
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,350
Junior World Championships, Gold 
Victor Nikiforov

273
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,350
Russia's Victor Nikiforov...

274
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,260
He won the gold in the Junior Worlds 
with the highest score in history!

275
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,100
He's so cool!

276
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,860
Victor would go like this!

277
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,360
This says Victor has a poodle.

278
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,850
His poodle's super cute!

279
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,850
Wow, so cute!

280
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,690
Huh? You have a poodle now, too?

281
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,800
Yeah. I named him "Victor."

282
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,370
You really like Victor, huh?

283
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,750
I hope I can see you compete 
against Victor soon.

284
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,040
Um, I wanted you to see this,

285
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,720
so I've been practicing it since 
the competitions ended.

286
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,480
Please watch.

287
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,010
<i>Last up is Victor Nikiforov from Russia.</i>

288
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,520
Victor Nikiforov (Age 27) 
Coach: Yakov Feltsman

289
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,520
All right, Victor!

290
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,780
Get 'em!

291
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,280
<i>It's clear he's Russia's hero! 
The cheers are deafening!</i>

292
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,960
Yuri, your favorite, Victor, is about to start!

293
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,530
<i>After the short program, he leads 
Giacometti, in second, by a huge margin.</i>

294
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,530
He's not back yet.

295
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,700
Huh? This is...

296
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,690
<i>In this program, he has four quads planned.</i>

297
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,460
<i>Here comes the first quad.</i>

298
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,760
<i>A quadruple Lutz!</i>

299
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,320
<i>Very clean!</i>

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,690
<i>The next quad is his signature move.</i>

301
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,850
<i>How will it go?</i>

302
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,360
<i>A quadruple flip! He lands this one, too!</i>

303
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,400
<i>Flying sit spin.</i>

304
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,880
<i>The music is "Stay Close to Me."</i>

305
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,240
Given that he has a million 
female fans worldwide,

306
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,240
<i>This program brings out a new dimension 
in Victor Nikiforov's performance.</i>

307
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,380
he's sure free with his charms.

308
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,140
You're drinking too much, Minako-senpai.

309
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,230
<i>A quadruple Salchow!</i>

310
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,370
This would tug at the 
heartstrings more if it were

311
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,010
a younger, more naïve man.

312
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,610
Not a hottie like Victor, but...

313
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,440
Let me think...

314
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,530
<i>A triple Lutz.</i>

315
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,240
<i>A triple flip!</i>

316
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,860
<i>Now, the last quad...</i>

317
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,980
<i>A quadruple toe loop,
followed by a triple toe loop!</i>

318
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,530
<i>He's landed all his quads!</i>

319
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,190
<i>Now, a combination spin!</i>

320
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,650
That was super cool!

321
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,720
A perfect copy of Victor! Awesome!

322
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,940
I thought you'd be depressed or something!

323
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,020
I was.

324
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,100
But I got bored of feeling depressed,

325
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,780
so I got to thinking...

326
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,780
I wanted to get my love for skating back.

327
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,280
I thought I could remember how it was 
when I copied Victor with you.

328
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,690
Yu-chan, I've...

329
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,660
<i>We now have a men's singles 
consecutive five-time winner</i>

330
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,810
<i>in the World Figure Skating Championships!</i>

331
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,670
<i>The victor is Russia's Victor Nikiforov!</i>

332
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,340
<i>What do you have in mind for next season?</i>

333
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,420
I've always...

334
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,180
Stare...

335
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,290
Axel, Lutz, and Loop!

336
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,790
Haven't they grown since you last saw them?

337
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,180
Y-Yeah.

338
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,020
Yuri, you really did get fat!

339
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Are you really retiring?

340
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,140
You've never had a girlfriend?

341
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,190
Hey!

342
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,690
Really, really, really?

343
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,270
Sorry, my girls are such groupies!

344
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,650
They're all your fans, Yuri.

345
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,840
Welcome back!

346
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,650
Nishigori!

347
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,710
Dad!

348
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,660
Now you're fatter than me.

349
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,660
H-Hey, stop that!

350
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,160
Congratulations on Advancing to the 
Grand Prix, Skater Katsuki Yuri

good-looking foreign guest!
