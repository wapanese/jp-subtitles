00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,440
Maccachin, behave while I'm gone, okay?

2
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,360
Don't you dare steal any steamed buns.

3
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,200
Victor, we're going to miss the flight!

We'll be rooting for you.

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,390
Good luck, Yuri!

8
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,950
I'll be right behind you!

9
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,410
I haven't flown coach in a while.

10
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,610
Want to get some champagne?

11
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,470
Um, Victor, can I get some sleep?

12
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,710
I'm surprised you can sleep 
in such a cramped seat!

13
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,950

Survive with the power of love...

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,160
Huh? How much power of love do I have?

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,140
Yuri, let's go have hot pot already.

51
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,070
Hey, I'm in the middle of an interview!

52
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,120
Oh, Yakov!

53
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,080
Hey, hey...

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,960
Want to come eat hot pot with us?

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,580
Hey, why are you ignoring me?

56
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,710
Victor!

57
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,140
Listen, I feel sick when I see 
you playing pretend-coach.

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,070
I'd prefer if you'd only talk to me when you're 
ready to plead for your return to skating.

59
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,220
Got it?

60
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,820
Yakov's not interested.

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,680
Let's go.

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,680
Look, Yuri!

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,850
Shanghai crab!

64
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,980
Drunken shrimp!

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,690
Duck blood!

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,190
Vkusno!

67
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,660
Huh? You're not eating the shrimp?

68
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,550
It's right before the competition, 
so I want to avoid raw food.

69
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,700
It's really good.

70
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,450
I ran my mouth too much 
at the press conference.

71
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,950
What will people say if I lose after all that?

72
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,640
Oh, Yuri?

73
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,780
Phichit-kun!

74
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,210
Phichit Chulanont, Age 20

75
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,210
So this is where you were eating.

76
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,960
Hi.

77
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,290
Oh, hello.

78
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,590
But talk about a coincidence.

79
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,470
Oh, can I invite Ciao Ciao?

80
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,940
Huh?

81
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,420
You want to see him, don't you?

82
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,340
Not really...

83
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,840
Ciao, ciao!

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Um, hello.

85
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,040
Want some shrimp?

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,130
Oh, that kind of food doesn't agree with me—

87
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,100
It's really good!

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,110
Guang-hong Ji, Age 17

89
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,110
Guang-hong!

90
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,550
I thought I'd find you eating here.

91
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,480
Leo-kun...

92
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,990
First Win 
Leo de la Iglesia, Age 19

93
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,990
I was worried because you weren't answering.

94
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,280
Sorry, sorry.

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960
I got a call from Phichit.

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,950
He wants me to come to a
hot pot place to interpret.

97
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,540
Huh? But I don't like hot pot.

98
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,770
Victor's there, too.

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,400
I'll go!

100
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Right?

101
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,410
I want a selfie with him to post online!

102
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,890
Okay, let's get right to it.

103
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,800
Yay!

104
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,210
Georgi Popovich, Age 27

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,210
So young...

106
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,210
Hurry up and finish.

107
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,710
Oh, sorry.

108
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,930
Victor's had way too much to drink.

109
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,210
Let's all go to a hot spring.

110
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,970
Celestino, keep it together!

111
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,050
Hot spring... Hasetsu Hot Springs, great place...

112
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,270
Victor.

113
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,470
What are you saying?

114
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,780
Hey! Don't strip!

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,780
This is getting kind of R-rated...

116
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,480
Age 19

117
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,480
Age 17

118
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,050
Is it okay to post this online?

119
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,480
Hey! Someone help!

120
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,480
Don't. Restrain yourself.

121
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,300
Hey, did you see the photo Phichit-kun upped?

122
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,230
That was pretty risqué!

123
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,940
Phichit-kun!

124
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,980
Sorry.

125
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,370
I couldn't stop myself from sharing it online.

126
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,740
Hey, we managed to hold back. Cheater.

127
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,030
<i>Now they'll think I was fooling 
around before the competition.</i>

128
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,990
<i>If I mess up now...</i>

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,690
Yuri, why didn't you invite me?

130
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,970
Chris...

131
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,580
Looks like you got into shape.

132
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,840
Christophe Giacometti, Age 25

133
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,240
Guess your master's giving you 
very thorough training.

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,050
Chris!

135
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,050
How's it going?

136
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,170
I'm not motivated without you.

137
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,860
Hey, Victor and Chris are together!

138
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,080
I want a photo with them at the banquet!

139
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,640
You're always like that at the start of a season.

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,190
Me, too!

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,190
Victor!

142
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,550
Chris is right.

143
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,890
He can't get serious without you.

144
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,100
Come back to the fold.

145
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,620
Victor!

146
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,280
Are you really a coach now?

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,370
Just split up with him already.

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,690
Yuri, the sin of keeping 
Victor to yourself is grave.

149
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,740
You know it won't last. 
Don't you feel sorry for him?

150
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,200
The whole world is hoping for his return.

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,200
Now, Group 1 in the Men's Singles Short 
Program is about to take to the ice.

152
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,380
Listen, Phichit.

153
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm certain that these short 
and free skate programs

154
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,100
will become your signature performances.

155
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,460
Looks like I don't need to say anything more.

156
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,930
First up is Phichit Chulanont 
from Thailand, age 20.

157
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,100
After placing fourth in Skate America, 
the first Grand Prix Series event,

158
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,010
he'll need to place second or higher 
here in order to qualify for the finals.

159
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,520
<i>This will be the first time a Thai 
skater performs this piece.</i>

160
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,920
<i>Write a new chapter for 
skating in Southeast Asia!</i>

161
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,870
The music is "Shall We Skate?" 
from <i>The King and the Skater.</i>

162
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,980
The audience is already clapping 
to the familiar theme.

163
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,450
<i>The King and the Skater</i> was 
the first movie he saw,

164
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,730
and it's had a big influence on him.

165
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,050
His first planned jump is a triple axel.

166
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,010
Nailed it.

167
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,810
<i>He's said he wanted to skate 
to this music for a long time.</i>

168
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,130
<i>Phichit-kun's giving everything 
he has to this season, too.</i>

169
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,790
<i>Many different people have skated to this music,</i>

170
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
<i>but I'll overwrite that history!</i>

171
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,010
<i>This music is mine!</i>

172
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,060
More jumps are on the way as his 
program enters its second half.

173
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,120
The first is a combination.

174
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,450
A triple Lutz, followed by a triple toe loop.

175
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,450
Yes!

176
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,530
Now we have a jump added to the 
second half to secure a win...

177
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,540
The quadruple toe loop.

178
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,830
Oh, he fell!

179
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,930
But he got enough rotations in.

180
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,150
He got up immediately, 
so his program's proceeding.

181
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,610
Following this, he'll do a combination spin.

182
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,140
<i>He's got the entire audience on his side.</i>

183
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
<i>He's made the music his own...</i>

184
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,300
Bravo!

185
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,310
An amazing performance by Phichit Chulanont!

186
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,370
Oh, man...

187
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,310
Keep it together!

188
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,810
His short program score is 86.75!

189
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,810
It's his new personal best by a large margin!

190
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,810
RK: 1 
Phichit Chulanont     Total

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,140
Yeah!

192
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,070
Next is a skater who made a grand debut 
in the first event, Skate America,

193
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,460
by finishing third.

194
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,440
Here's Guang-hong Ji from China, age 17, 
now competing on his home turf.

195
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,110
Guang-hong! Jiayou!

196
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,830
He is skating to "Le Parfum des Fleurs."

197
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,660
<i>Phichit-kun was amazing.</i>

198
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,710
<i>Wait, I can do this.</i>

199
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,320
His first planned jump is a quadruple toe loop,

200
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,710
which was just added to his roster this year.

201
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,650
Guang-hong landed his quadruple toe loop!

202
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,650
<i>After seeing Phichit-kun's performance, 
I'm no longer unsure.</i>

203
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>People who want to see Victor skate will 
never be satisfied with my skating.</i>

204
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,940
<i>The people who're cheering for me wouldn't 
be satisfied with the old me, either.</i>

205
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,440
<i>If that's the case,</i>

206
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,540
<i>I want to be hated as the man who 
took Victor from the whole world!</i>

207
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,940
Victor, is he all right?

208
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,550
Shh!

209
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,920
I've never seen Yuri like this.

210
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,250
Yuri, it's about to start.

211
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,440
Come watch with us.

212
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,270
I'm fine.

213
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,020
I'll watch from over here.

214
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,770
The last skater from Group 1 
is Katsuki Yuri from Japan.

215
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,440
The time to seduce me by picturing pork cutlet 
bowls and women during your skate is over.

216
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,730
You can fight with your own personal charm.

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,700
You can envision it just fine, can't you?

218
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,540
Don't ever take your eyes off me.

219
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,800
<i>He's far too different today.</i>

220
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,720
<i>What's flipped his switch?</i>

221
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,530
K-Katsuki Yuri from Japan is skating his 
first program of the Grand Prix series.

222
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,320
He is skating to "On Love: Eros."

223
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,420
He's declared this year's theme to be "love."

224
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,020
Well, he's certainly changed 
drastically from previous seasons.

225
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,290
Maybe living with his coach, Victor, 
has changed things for him mentally.

226
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,920
Katsuki has told us he'd like to 
pursue eros in his short program.

227
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,400
<i>They can laugh at me all they want.</i>

228
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,260
<i>They can think it's not like me.</i>

229
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,960
<i>But everyone really wants to know 
the new me, don't they?</i>

230
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,140
Perfect!

231
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,650
What an amazing step sequence!

232
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,650
That was wonderful!

233
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,650
Wow.

234
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,400
Katsuki Yuri has planned all his jumps 
for the second half of the program

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,030
to get higher scores so he can 
win the Grand Prix Final.

236
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,660
Well, this will be tough.

237
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,340
The first planned jump is a triple axel.

238
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,880
Here we go, from a spread eagle into...

239
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,260
a triple axel.

240
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,350
Nice distance!

241
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, next up is a quadruple Salchow.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,560
In competition, he's landed it 
less than 30% of the time.

243
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,530
A quadruple Salchow.

244
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,910
He nailed it!

245
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,370
<i>I'm the only one who can satisfy Victor.</i>

246
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,700
<i>I'm the only one in the whole world 
who knows Victor's love.</i>

247
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,370
<i>I'll prove that now.</i>

248
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,730
Quadruple toe loop, followed by a triple toe loop.

249
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,950
He did it!

250
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,030
So far, all the jumps have been flawless!

251
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,970
<i>He's totally different from last year...</i>

252
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,170
He's about to complete a short program with 
the highest technical difficulty in history!

253
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,320
You're witnessing the birth 
of a new Katsuki Yuri!

254
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,120
Love wins!

255
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,570
No one can deny that this was 
a perfect performance!

256
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,500
It's a personal best for Katsuki Yuri.

257
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,940
Yuri!

258
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,820
The audience is still on their feet!

259
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,160
He used last season's disappointment 
as a springboard

260
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,330
to learn what love is, and he's undergone 
an astounding transformation!

261
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,190
That was perfect.

262
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,080
Yuri!

263
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,330
The kiss and cry's that way.

264
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,090
Well, his coach, Victor, looks very happy!

265
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,840
Yuri, did it feel that great?

266
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,170
Well, I was hoping everyone else 
felt great watching me.

267
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,440
And we have his short program score: 106.84!

268
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,400
A new personal best!

269
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,340
He's currently in first place!

270
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,360
Yuri!

271
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,610
Of course they'd feel great 
watching a performance like that.

272
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,860
You're the best student.

273
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,240
You don't look amused, Chris.

274
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,700
Focus, focus!

275
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,490
Wow.

276
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,220
He's never scored that high before.

277
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,370
Don't worry about it.

278
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,830
The free skate is where it counts.

279
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,400
Besides, Yuri isn't used to 
being the one to beat.

280
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,890
Listen.

281
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,470
You've been in Victor's shadow all this time,

282
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,470
but now is your chance.

283
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,990
Go make your mark.

284
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,720
Got it.

285
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,420
Hey, Georgi's about to start.

286
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,480
Whatever.

287
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,870
<i>Now that Victor's gone,</i>

288
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,630
<i>I'm the new top skater in Russia.</i>

289
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,790
Georgi Popovich, age 27, from Russia.

290
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,130
This season's theme is "heartbreak."

291
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,130
He is skating to "Carabosse" 
from <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>.

292
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,870
A triple axel.

293
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,080
This still cracks me up every time.

294
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,300
<i>As the evil witch, Carabosse, 
I cast a curse on her.</i>

295
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,590
<i>Only true love's kiss can awaken her.</i>

296
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,430
Dasvidaniya.

297
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,550
<i>But there is no such thing as true love!</i>

298
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,080
Oh, I heard he broke up with the ice dancer

299
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,440
he always used to post kissy photos with.

300
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,560
She hooked up with a different guy recently.

301
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,140
Did you know that, Yuri?

302
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,570
Shut up, hag!

303
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,060
A quadruple Salchow.

304
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,050
What an emotional performance!

305
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,860
Yikes, he's actually crying.

306
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,750
Seriously?

307
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,730
<i>I'll hunt you to the ends of 
the earth, and I'll find you!</i>

308
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,390
<i>"Forgive me. I was wrong, Georgi."</i>

309
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,680
<i>"Never, you traitor!"</i>

310
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,220
<i>"No! Oh!"</i>

311
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,310
A triple Lutz, triple loop combination.

312
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,410
I can almost hear her terrified voice.

313
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,810
He's way too into this performance.

314
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,730
His step sequence is intense.

315
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,160
<i>I will cast an eternal curse on her.</i>

316
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,890
<i>I am an evil witch!</i>

317
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,360
<i>My curse will cause her to sleep for eternity.</i>

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,690
<i>Georgi,</i>

319
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,000
<i>I'm finally seeing a performance 
worthy of who you are.</i>

320
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,500
Georgi Popovich's short program score is 98.17.

321
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,760
He is currently in second place.

322
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,370
Oh, right.

323
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,270
His ex is also competing in the Cup of China.

324
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,510
Seriously?

325
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,770
That's gotta suck.

326
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,950
Leo de la Iglesia, age 19, from the United States.

327
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,900
Leo-kun's performance has been really 
polished ever since the first event.

328
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,110
He is skating to "Still Alive," 
choreographed by the skater himself.

329
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,960
<i>It's a song I like, so I just want to 
skate the way I see the music.</i>

330
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,390
<i>That's all.</i>

331
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,320
A triple axel.

332
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,230
<i>I want to fill the whole world with things I like!</i>

333
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,650
Man, Leo-kun's so cool.

334
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,290
He's switched things up even 
more since Skate America.

335
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,400
After winning Skate America,

336
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,070
he is closest among those 
competing in the Cup of China

337
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,070
to qualifying for the Grand Prix Final.

338
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,090
There are no quads in his program,

339
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,250
but he's earned high marks for the five program 
components, such as interpretation.

340
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,560
A triple flip, triple toe loop combination.

341
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,190
He's nailing all the elements
to go for a high score!

342
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,670
<i>All I know for sure is that I have no idea 
how I would've found courage in myself</i>

343
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,660
<i>if I hadn't come across music.</i>

344
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,370
A triple Lutz.

345
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,130
He nailed the last jump with a flourish!

346
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,840
This program maximizes Leo-kun's strengths.

347
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,150
That was Leo de la Iglesia 
from the United States.

348
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,090
Hear the crowd roar! 
That was a solid short program!

349
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,060
What an amazing program after Skate America!

352

Thanks! Bravo!

353
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,900
He is currently in third place.

354
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Wow.

355
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,330
Man, Leo-kun beat me, too.

356
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,410
Damn it...

357
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,760
The final skater is Christophe Giacometti, 
age 25, from Switzerland.

358
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,380
He's the silver medalist in 
last year's Grand Prix Final.

359
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,630
He's just oozing sex appeal!

360
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,950
<i>I thought it'd be a boring
season without Victor,</i>

361
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,930
<i>but I don't want to lose to you, Yuri.</i>

362
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,250
<i>Mature eros is my specialty.</i>

363
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,360
He is skating to "Intoxicated."

364
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,500
He's planned a quadruple Lutz right off the bat.

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,620
Oh, it turned into a triple.

366
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,390
<i>Oh, well...</i>

367
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,450
<i>I'll take it slow so I peak at the Grand Prix Final.</i>

368
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,850
A combination spin. 
Beautiful position and speed.

369
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,600
He said he wasn't finding motivation,

370
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,040
but Chris never goes into a major slump.

371
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,100
He's a slow starter, so he doesn't 
try to peak in the first event.

372
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,880
But today, he's really going all-out on sex appeal.

373
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,610
<i>Yuri, your innocent sex appeal is a violent force.</i>

374
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,460
<i>I'm the only one in the world 
who can win against that.</i>

375
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,510
A triple axel.

376
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,570
<i>I won't be able to settle down until 
I show just how far ahead of you I am.</i>

377
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,790
A triple flip, followed by a triple toe loop.

378
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,810
There he goes!

379
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,360
His last spin is met with loud 
cheers from the crowd!

380
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,810
<i>I think I'm gonna come...</i>

381
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,100
Christophe Giacometti has delivered 
a euphoric short program!

382
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,540
He's entranced us all!

383
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,970
Chris!

384
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,220
He's a weapon of mass sex appeal.

385
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,010
I guess today's sex appeal award goes to Chris.

386
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,220
The ice looks soaking wet.

3rd Place

I'll get my ticket to the Grand Prix

Finishing in second is within my

I won't lose to a third-rate coach.

At the end of the men's short program 
here at the Cup of China,

Katsuki Yuri from Japan is in first place!

407

That boy isn't used to being in first place.

408
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,100
Skater Katsuki, your thoughts 
on the upcoming free skate?

409
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,100
I hope he'll be okay.

410
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,430
W-With my coach, Victor, 
I'll win with the power of love!
