52
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,380
Yuri.

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes?

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,360
His coach is empowering their matching 
rings in a prayer for victory.

55
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,610
Why matching rings?

56
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,290
Yuri, good luck!

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,220
Lucky... I wish I had one with Sala!

58
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,720
Sure. I'll say something you won't 
even have to think about.

59
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,480
Tomorrow, show me the skating that 
you can honestly say you liked best.

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,730
I'm off!

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,950
He's greeted by a roaring 
crowd as he takes the ice.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,290
Yuri!

63
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,740
Katsuki Yuri of Japan.

64
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,740
You can do it!

65
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,240
Yuri-kun!

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,220
One year after he finished 
the Final in last place,

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,700
Katsuki Yuri is about to start his short program.

68
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,870
He is skating to "On Love: Eros."

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,360
So, Oda-san, he's supposedly changed 
his jump composition in this program.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,940
Yes, after the Rostelecom Cup, 
it was changed for even higher marks.

71
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,740
<i>Even if I top my personal 
best again, I can't beat JJ.</i>

72
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,190
<i>His program has 5.22 points on mine 
in the jumps' base value alone.</i>

73
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,950
<i>If I don't change my program...</i>

74
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,680
You want to change the jump to a 
quad flip in your short program?

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,200
You've barely even landed that 
jump cleanly in practice.

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,220
Yeah.

77
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,580
But I still have time to improve the execution.

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,860
Finding out how far I can push my limits to win

79
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,840
will motivate me to fight through the Final!

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,140
Don't you want to see it, Victor?

81
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,720
To see me land a quadruple flip with a +3 GOE?

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,080
I do!

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,010
Right?

84
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,420
<i>Since then, I've focused practice 
time on the quadruple flip,</i>

85
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,330
<i>but my success rate is still low.</i>

86
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,690
<i>I've decided to go for it, though.</i>

87
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,420
<i>Yuri doesn't doubt his decisions anymore.</i>

88
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,930
<i>And yet, I feel like my own 
heart is about to explode.</i>

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,570
A triple axel.

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,320
That jump has a difficult entry, 
so it will get higher marks.

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,750
Next up is a quadruple jump combination.

92
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,750
Quadruple Salchow, triple toe loop.

93
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,750
Yes!

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,270
Another success!

95
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,840
<i>Excitement courses through 
the body, down to the toes,</i>

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,590
<i>and is released!</i>

97
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,890
Now, the highly anticipated quadruple flip.

98
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,390
<i>Good, just use that speed to...</i>

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,650
A quadruple flip,

100
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,140
but one hand on the ice.

101
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,520
That spin received a level four 
rating again this season.

102
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,520
That was close!

103
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,190
That flip had enough rotation, right?

104
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,030
It was fine!

105
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,280
Yuri-kun's sit spin position is so beautiful!

106
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,840
Dad, what would the base value be?

107
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm calculating that now!

108
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,800
What do you have in mind for next season?

109
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,180
<i>When I approached every program 
like a new beginning,</i>

110
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,820
<i>I could always surprise everyone.</i>

111
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,320
<i>But that also held me back...</i>

112
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,210
<i>"I can only find new strength on my own."</i>

113
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,660
<i>That's what I always thought.</i>

114
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,170

It didn't break the 100 mark, 
but it's still a high score.

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,680
<i>Now I can feel new emotions 
flowing into me through Yuri.</i>

119
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,440
<i>What should I give Yuri now?</i>

120
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,910
Next is Thailand's Phichit Chulanont.

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,620
He is skating to "Shall We Skate?"

122
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,370
He has a lot of supporters here from Thailand.

123
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,590
Here comes the first jump...

124
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,930
A triple axel.

125
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,930
Phichit Chulanont is the first Thai skater 
to advance to a Grand Prix Final.

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,390
His career began when his 
talent was discovered

127
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,670
as he skated at a rink in a 
Bangkok commercial district.

128
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,640
He moved to Detroit by himself 
to train under Coach Celestino.

129
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,070
Last year, he made Thailand 
his home rink again.

130
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,120
Triple Lutz, triple toe loop.

131
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,830
<i>My only quad is the toe loop.</i>

132
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,950
<i>It'll be hard to earn higher 
scores than the others.</i>

133
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,910
A quadruple toe loop.

134
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,990
<i>I have no past accomplishments to defend.</i>

135
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,570
<i>This is my new beginning!</i>

136
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,750
<i>It's a waste if I'm not as excited as a child</i>

137
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,270
Massimo!

138
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,630
<i>drawing art no one's ever seen 
before on a blank canvas!</i>

139
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,240
Yuri...

140
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,800
I want to skate to "Shall We Skate?"

141
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,600
Even though it stars a Thai actor,

142
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,890
no Thai skater has ever used 
the music in a program.

143
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,570
Someday, I'll skate to it 
at a major competition.

144
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,320
You'll be there, too, Yuri!

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,020
That was a flawless performance 
from Phichit Chulanont!

146
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,760
Bravo!

147
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,380
He seems to be feeling a release 
from the immense pressure.

148
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,430
Really, that was amazing.

149
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,190
<i>Phichit-kun... You were a perfect 
entertainer until the very end!</i>

150
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,480
How long are you idiots gonna 
sit in the kiss and cry?!

That's a new personal best!

Yeah!

158
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,700
He's currently in second!

160
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,740
Yurio!

161
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,920
Davai! Davai!

162
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,050
He is skating to "On Love: Agape."

163
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,050
The program was choreographed 
by Victor Nikiforov.

164
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,340
Yuri Plisetsky has said that his 
relative lack of experience

165
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,200
kept him from skating to his full potential 
at the Rostelecom Cup due to nerves.

166
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,730
Here comes the first jump.

167
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,340
A triple axel.

168
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,840
He used a raised arm with the jump, earning 
higher marks for a greater degree of difficulty.

169
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,330
A flying sit spin.

170
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,540
He won at the Golden Spin, 
held right before the Final.

171
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,210
All Yuri lacks in the senior division is experience.

172
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,590
Yuri has sought help to address that,

173
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,940
and we have provided the resources.

174
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,340
His short program will have "agape" as its theme.

175
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,630
I believe he's found an entrance to "love" 
through his many encounters with others.

176
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,560
People shine brightest when they

177
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,810
seek to understand what kind 
of love sustains them.

178
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,320
<i>Vitya...</i>

179
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,830
Now, in the second half of his program,

180
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,210
we'll see a quadruple-triple combination.

181
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,050
Quadruple Salchow, triple toe loop.

182
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,860
That was mind-blowing!

183
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,180
He did the jump with one arm raised. 
It was perfect.

184
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,490
The last jump is also a quad.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,250
A quadruple toe loop.

186
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,670
He did it!

187
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,540
This time, he had both arms raised.

188
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,830
All of his jumps were flawless!

189
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,350
Here comes the step sequence.

190
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,980
<i>Huh? Victor's not here.</i>

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,240
He's attempting difficult elements 
with the highest possible execution.

192
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,950
A beautiful monster continues to 
evolve to even greater heights!

193
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
<i>Oh... My mind went blank in the middle of it.</i>

194
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,020
Victorâ

195
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,200
What score will we see here?

196
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Yuri Plisetsky's score is 118.56!

I've got this!

200
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,460
That's my Yuratchka!

201
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,470
I got curious about how it was going, too.

202
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,560
Chris is about to take the ice. 
Let's find a seat.

203
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay.

204
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,390
The next skater is Christophe Giacometti 
of Switzerland, age 25.

205
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,690
The audience is still awestruck by 
Yuri Plisetsky's new world record,

206
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,400
Chris!

207
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,150
but the arena is filling with Swiss flags!

208
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,730
He is skating to "Intoxicated."

209
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,490
He's changing the mood 180 degrees, 
from agape to adult sex appeal.

210
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,460
He's planned a quad for his first jump.

211
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,910
A quadruple Lutz.

212
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,800
Look at the flow of that jump!

213
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,580
Combination spin.

214
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,480
Though he's advanced to the Final each year,

215
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,980
Christophe Giacometti has never won the event.

216
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,740
How does longtime rival Victor Nikiforov feel

217
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,440
as he watches him perform from the audience?

218
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,240
<i>Yuri, you're not the only skater</i>

219
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,960
<i>who's always watched Victor 
climb the podium until now.</i>

220
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,710
<i>Given my age, I won't be able to 
qualify for the Final much longer.</i>

221
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,680
<i>To tell the truth, the first season 
without Victor is boring...</i>

222
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,230
Chris, we're here.

223
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,610
You always come too early.

224
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,180
<i>But that's why I'll make 
this Final extra special!</i>

225
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,730
A triple axel.

226
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,920
That was perfect.

227
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,990
The jump's height and distance were flawless.

228
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,490
<i>Victor, watch this from the audience.</i>

229
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,710
<i>Victor...</i>

230
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,680
<i>I thought the same thing when 
he watched Yurio earlier, but...</i>

231
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,430
Oops, that quad was just a bit under-rotated.

232
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,280
<i>His last jump had a flaw,
but of course, it's still Chris.</i>

233
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,720
<i>Everything in his program has great execution.</i>

234
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,430
<i>He may outscore me.</i>

235
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,730
<i>I don't give up that easily, you know.</i>

236
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,170
Christophe Giacometti's score is 102.37!

237
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,090
Chris!

238
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,910
He's passed Katsuki Yuri and is 
currently in second place.

239
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,830
Davai!

240
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,830
Now we have Otabek Altin of Kazakhstan.

241
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,840
This is his very first Final, after finishing 
the Grand Prix Series in second.

242
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,580
Davai!

243
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,590
He is skating to "Samarkand Overture."

244
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,040
Altin is a dark horse in this 
year's Grand Prix Series.

245
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
He was telling us that he'd like to 
bring gold back to his country.

246
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,380
Here's the first jump.

247
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,970
Quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop!

248
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,000
Success!

249
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,760
Otabek wasn't very memorable in the past.

250
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,710
He's completely different now.

251
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,710
He wasn't known at all until the junior division.

252
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,720
Otabek, why are you embarrassed?

253
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,450
<i>I have fewer resources, and the 
other talent is overwhelming.</i>

254
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>If I can't demonstrate something they can't do,</i>

255
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,480
<i>I'll never win.</i>

256
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,470
<i>I haven't done ballet ever since.</i>

257
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,150
<i>There is no right path.</i>

258
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,490
<i>The ice is a battlefield.</i>

259
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,780
<i>I am going to survive!</i>

260
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,030
A triple axel.

261
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,380
Look at that height and distance!

262
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,540
That's Otabek Altin's triple axel!

263
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,140
The last jump...

264
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,420
A quadruple Salchow.

265
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,880
That had great flow!

266
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,760
<i>Otabek's jumps were flawless, too.</i>

267
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,940
<i>His skating shows no hesitation.</i>

268
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,270
<i>That determination is very much his trademark.</i>

269
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,590
Another score higher than the pig's.

270
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,760
He's great.

271
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,380
That was very exotic!

272
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,770
It felt so fresh!

Hmm, the quadruple toe loop...

He'd planned a combination,
