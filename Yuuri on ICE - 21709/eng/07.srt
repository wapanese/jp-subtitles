<i>I'm Katsuki Yuri, a figure 
skater representing Japan</i>

2
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,990
<i>who's in the middle of the Grand 
Prix Series' Cup of China!</i>

3
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,910
<i>I ended the short program in first place 
after scoring a personal high score!</i>

4
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,910
<i>I'm now within reach of my first victory 
in a Grand Prix Series event!</i>

5
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,530
Congratulations, Yuri.

6
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,910
We got really fired up!

7
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,670
That was the hottest performance ever!

8
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,340
Keep it up in your free program!

9
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,340
Yuri, that was awesome!

10
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,420
Good luck!

11
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,420
Awesome, awesome!

12
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,810
China's On! The Grand Prix Series Opening Event!!

13
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Seventh Skate 
China's On! The Grand Prix Series Opening Event!! 
The Cup of China Free Skate

14
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,420
The Cup of China Free Skate.

15
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,750
Yuri, you haven't slept, have you?

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,420
I-I-I did! A little bit, anyway.

17
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,310
Nap until this evening's event starts.

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,350
It'll be fine.

19
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,690
I always slept in until the last minute
before competitions, too.

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,630
Victor! Did you set an alarm?!

21
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,440
We're at the third event of the 
Grand Prix Series, the Cup of China.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,580
The men's singles free skate is about to start!

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,330
Huh? It won't open.

24
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Yuri, were you unable to take a nap?

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,400
Huh?

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,460
I did nap! I did!

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,670
I forbid you from doing jumps 
in the six-minute warm-up.

28
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,550
Huh?!

29
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,920
That's an order from your coach, Yuri.

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,990
Now, in the second half of the event,

31
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,680
Group 2 is taking the ice.

32
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,200
<i>If he flubs a jump during the warm-up,</i>

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,680
<i>he may lose even more confidence, 
and it'd negatively impact his free skate.</i>

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,950
<i>Yuri gets nervous easily.</i>

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Let's hope skater Katsuki is all right.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,940
He looks rather glum after the warm-up.

37
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,690
Oh, my.

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,690
That face...

39
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,200
We've seen that face often.

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,700
Well, it's common for skaters to nail 
something they flubbed during practice!

41
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm sorry...

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,440
Well, just continue warming up, nice and easy.

43
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,340
Guang-hong, keep it together.

44
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,090
You have the perfect program that 
we prepared just for today!

45
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,090
Guang-hong!

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,610
Become China's hero!

47
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,940
First up is Guang-hong Ji, 
China's young ace, age 17.

48
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,930
He's in sixth place after the short program.

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,720
He is skating to "The Inferno," 
from the movie <i>Shanghai Blade</i>.

50
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,460
His theme this year is "bonds and violence."

51
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,920
<i>I went with this music because 
my coach pushed it so hard,</i>

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,290
<i>but how does skating as an underworld 
assassin help me become a hero?</i>

53
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,460
Oh! It looks like he over-rotated,

54
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,370
but that's another quadruple toe loop, 
following the one in his short program!

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,260
<i>I've been living in Shanghai's seamy underbelly,</i>

56
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,940
<i>but this is my last job.</i>

57
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,050
<i>With my trusty sword, I can 
handle it just fine on my own!</i>

58
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,380
A triple axel, single loop, and a triple Salchow.

59
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,810
<i>All right. It's going even better 
than it did during the warm-up.</i>

60
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,980
He's nailed all his jumps in the first half!

61
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Will he grab a ticket to the Grand Prix Final 
in his very first Grand Prix series?

62
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,280
There will be more jumps in the second half.

63
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,250
A triple flip, followed by a triple toe loop...

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,240
He fell!

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,790
<i>Guess I won't be catching up with a
flawless performance to place first.</i>

66
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,500
A triple loop, followed by a double loop.

67
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
He's back on track!

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,920
<i>How did the story go from here?</i>

69
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,920
<i>The protagonist infiltrates the enemy 
lair and fights his way to the top,</i>

70
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,570
<i>where the boss awaits.</i>

71
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,310
<i>He is reunited with longtime allies.</i>

72
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,730
<i>Now that the pressure's off, 
there's opportunity!</i>

73
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,790
Here comes the step sequence.

74
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,840
What speed! It's like watching a car chase!

75
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,730
He's taking us right to the climax.

76
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>The protagonist has a duel with 
the enemy organization's boss.</i>

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,870
<i>His allies are hunted by the organization.</i>

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,690
The last jump is a double axel.

79
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,740
Success!

80
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>My Grand Prix Series will end here,</i>

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
<i>but the Four Continents and the 
Worlds are still waiting for me.</i>

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,720
<i>I'll raise the technical difficulty of my
programs and claw my way to the podium!</i>

83
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,020
<i>I'm not the kind of man who'd die in a ditch here!</i>

84
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,520
Guang-hong Ji, enveloped in loud applause!

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,940
Guang-hong Ji's combined score

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,530
RK: 1 
Guang-hong Ji     Total

87
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,370
is 248.69. He's currently in first place.

88
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,410
I'm going to quit all social media to practice!

89
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,500
Chris, like I keep saying, 
just go at your own pace.

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,790
Right.

91
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,460
Chris!

92
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,990
Next, in fifth after the short program,

93
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,250
Christophe Giacometti, 
representing Switzerland, age 25.

94
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,910
He is skating to "Rapsodie Espagnole."

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,960
An error in the short program 
caused his technical score

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,050
to fall below that of China's Guang-hong Ji,

97
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,430
but his presentation score went 
well above to place him fifth.

98
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,850
In his free skate, he has prepared 
three quads in the first half.

99
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,690
The first jump is his signature move, 
the high-difficulty quadruple Lutz!

100
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,990
Success!

101
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,540
<i>He's far from where he was at 
the European Championships,</i>

102
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,440
<i>but he's still in competitive 
mode after the short program.</i>

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,500
<i>That's unusual.</i>

104
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,000
Next up is a quadruple Salchow.

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,530
<i>Next is his triple axel, single loop,
triple Salchow combination.</i>

106
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,140
<i>Take off in front of that ad.</i>

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,650
<i>And...</i>

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,910
<i>There!</i>

109
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,070
He nailed the jump combination!

110
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,610
Yuri, let's warm up in a different spot.

111
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,240
<i>What's the place with the fewest people?</i>

112
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,910
<i>I'm the only one who can skate 
exactly the way I want.</i>

113
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,030
<i>I thought Victor was the same as me, 
living for life on the ice.</i>

114
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,510
Quadruple Salchow, double toe loop.

115
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,750
That was a perfect landing!

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,270
<i>It's not like you to leave the ice and find 
someone you want to protect, Victor.</i>

117
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,270
<i>We met ten years ago,</i>

118
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,270
<i>when you'd won the European Championships</i>

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,870
<i>and I'd just debuted in the senior division.</i>

120
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,900
Victor! Congrats!

121
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,460
What's your name?

122
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,900
Christophe Giacometti!

123
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,070
Okay.

124
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,160
Chris,

125
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,160
see you at the Worlds.

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,390
Yeah!

127
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,660
<i>Yuri can't surpass you.</i>

128
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
<i>I'll win this season!</i>

129
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,790
<i>And I'll bring Victor back to the ice!</i>

130
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,020
A triple axel.

131
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,230
He landed his last jump!

132
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,340
<i>The next time you come to stand by me,</i>

133
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,680
<i>I believe I'll be the one 
standing in the middle.</i>

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,390
<i>I think I'm gonna come again...</i>

135
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,860
Th-That was perfect!

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,020
Bravo!

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,040
He leads Guang-hong Ji by a huge margin,

140
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,010
Merci!

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,380
taking first place!

142
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,380
Victor, what are the current standings?

143
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,800
O-Okay, Yuri.

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,380
First, let's take deep breaths.

145
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,890
Thailand's Phichit Chulanont, age 20.

146
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,910
He is skating to "Terra Incognita," 
from <i>The King and the Skater II</i>.

147
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,750
A triple axel!

148
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,850
<i>Yeah!</i>

149
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,120
<i>I'm going to become Thailand's future!</i>

150
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,730
<i>The audience has been in love with Phichit 
since his short program yesterday.</i>

151
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,500
<i>Unlike Yuri, he has tremendous innate flair.</i>

152
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,990
The loud cheers speak to the high expectations 
we have for Phichit Chulanont.

153
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,840
Coming up next is a triple Lutz.

154
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,130
<i>Chris and Yuri are always ahead of me,</i>

155
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,260
<i>with their two quads and higher 
ratings on their five components.</i>

156
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,720
<i>With only one quad under my belt,</i>

157
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,100
<i>the only way I can stay ahead is to put all my 
quads in the second half for more points!</i>

158
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,060
<i>I'm the one who'll advance 
to the Grand Prix Final!</i>

159
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,650
This expressive footwork is also one of 
his unique qualities as a Thai skater.

160
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,140
Here come the jumps in the 
second half, the first quad...

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,230
A quadruple toe loop!

162
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,910
Success!

163
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,580
<i>Until very recently, I bet no 
one thought a Thai skater</i>

164
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,080
<i>would land a quad at a Grand Prix series event.</i>

165
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,310
<i>I've always believed in myself, though!</i>

166
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,560
Quadruple toe loop, followed by 
a double toe loop!

167
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,550
He landed the second quad, too!

168
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,550
Bravo!

169
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,350
<i>It's something only I can do,
not copying anyone else.</i>

170
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,150
The only remaining jumps are a triple flip, 
single loop, double flip combination.

171
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,160
He nailed it!

172
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,370
All his jumps were flawless!

173
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,370
Figure skating history in Thailand...

174
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,680
no, in Asia...

175
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,210
is being rewritten before our eyes

176
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,210
by 20-year-old Phichit Chulanont!

177
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,170
Okay.

178
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,730
Don't listen!

179
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,670
In his first event, Skate America, 
Chulanont finished fourth.

180
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,610
In his second event, the Cup of China, 
will he score his first victory?

181
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,720
If so, he'll be on the cusp of 
becoming the first Thai skater

182
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,150
to advance to the Grand Prix Final!

183
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,150
Oh! His total score is 285.76!

184
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,790
He took the lead over Giacometti!

185
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah!

186
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,050
Well done, student.

187
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,800
This is his season's top score, of course!

188
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,190
Please root for me in the Grand Prix Final!

189
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,230
Hey, you don't know if you'll make it yet.

190
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,510
Oh, right.

191
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,920
I won Skate America.

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
That's right!

193
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,250
I ended yesterday's short program in third.

194
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,870
Well done!

195
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,330
Of everyone here, I'm the 
closest to the Grand Prix Final!

196
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,140
That's right!

197
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,980
Representing the United States, 
Leo de la Iglesia, age 19.

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
<i>I understand how you might be 
affected by other skaters' standings</i>

199
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,030
<i>if you were younger.</i>

200
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,360
<i>But why is Yuri so nervous?</i>

201
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,870
<i>How can I motivate Yuri?</i>

202
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,950
<i>I have no idea.</i>

203
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,780
V-Victor?

204
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,610
It's almost time.

205
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,730
We need to get back.

206
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,920
<i>Skaters' hearts are as fragile as glass.</i>

207
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,590
<i>If their hearts are so fragile...</i>

208
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,330
Yuri.

209
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,430
Huh?

210
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,690
<i>Let's try shattering his into pieces.</i>

211
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,980
If you mess up this free skate 
and miss the podium,

212
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,440
I'll take responsibility by 
resigning as your coach.

213
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,460
Why would you say something like that, 
like you're trying to test me?

214
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,210
<i>It shattered!</i>

215
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,920
Uh, sorry, Yuri.

216
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,080
I wasn't being seriousâ€”

217
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,180
I'm used to being blamed for my own failures!

218
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,470
But this time, I'm anxious because my 
mistakes would reflect on you, too!

219
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,100
I've been wondering if you secretly want to quit!

220
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,750
Of course I don't.

221
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,950
I know!

222
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,770
I'm not good with people crying in front of me.

223
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,490
I don't know what I should do.

224
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,260
Should I just kiss you or something?

225
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,240
No!

226
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,310
Just have more faith than I do that I'll win!

227
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,120
You don't have to say anything.

Your prayer reached the world.

233

Yeah.

234
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,260
I'll work hard in the US Nationals.

Next on the ice is Georgi Popovich, 
age 27, representing Russia.

236
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,020
He is skating to "A Tale of the Sleeping Prince."

237

<i>I love you so much!</i>

240

Here's a quadruple Salchow, 
triple toe loop combination.

241
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,450
His theme for this season is "heartbreak."

242
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,950
He said he hopes people will notice

243
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,540
his new range of artistic 
expression in his performance.

244
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,930
<i>Sorry I cast an eternal curse 
on you, my princess.</i>

245
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,210
<i>I'm sure you've been waiting for 
your prince's kiss all this time.</i>

246
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,830
Here comes a triple loop.

247
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,670
Let's go.

<i>Anya, don't run away!</i>

250
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,530
<i>I'm the one who'll protect you!</i>

251
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,110
<i>No!</i>

252
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,850

<i>I refuse to believe it!</i>

254
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,600
Next up is a quadruple Salchow.

255
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,210
He fell!

256
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,670
<i>Wake up!</i>

257
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,540
<i>Of all my students, you've been the
most receptive to my instructions.</i>

258
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,300
<i>That was one of your weaknesses, as well.</i>

259
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,410
<i>But this program realizes all the 
things Victor lacks as a skater.</i>

260
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,260
<i>Skate with more confidence!</i>

261
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,400
Next is a triple flip.

262
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,640
Great!

263
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,110
He carries himself with such dignity!

264
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,110
<i>"Please wake me up."</i>

265
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,820

<i>From now on, it's my time to shine!</i>

274
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,850
Oops, I forgot to watch the free skate.

275
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,090
I wonder if Yuri-kun's okay.

276
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,900
Don't his eyes look red?

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,630
You're right!

278
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,820
I wonder if something happened 
between him and Victor.

Katsuki Yuri from Japan, in first

<i>Um, so the first jump...</i>

299
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,730
<i>A quadruple toe loop, 
double toe loop combination.</i>

300
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,600
Quadruple... Double.

301
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,980
<i>Better than I expected.</i>

302
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,240
His first quad was a success.

In this free skate, Katsuki Yuri plans to do

He's unusually relaxed today.

305

<i>It's not like my mental weakness

Grand Prix Final gold medal!

316
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,910
Katsuki Yuri made an emphatic 
declaration at the press conference.

317
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
A triple loop.

318
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,410
Beautiful.

319
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,370
Next is one of his favorites, the triple axel.

320
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,480
Oops, he touched down!

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,460

<i>It went pretty well, despite not 
doing it during warm-up.</i>

323

<i>Next up is a triple flip.</i>

324

<i>Oh, I wonder how Victor would react</i>

325
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,760
<i>if I made the last quad a 
flip instead of a toe loop.</i>

326
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,420
Coming next is a triple axel, single 
loop, triple Salchow combination.

327
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,970
He over-rotated that one.

328
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,600
<i>I over-rotated, but I'm not as tired 
as I should be, given I haven't slept.</i>

329
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,230
A triple Lutz, triple toe loop combination.

330
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,650
Even in the second half, he's not 
showing any sign of fatigue.

331
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,610
Moving on to the step sequence.

332
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>I want to become stronger...</i>

333
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,860
<i>I can become stronger.</i>

334
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,130
<i>I can surpass Victor's wildest imagination!</i>

335
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,170
He's planned a quadruple toe 
loop for his final jump.

336
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,400
I-It's a quadruple flip!

337
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,860
He fell, but there appeared 
to be enough rotations!

338
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,510
The quadruple flip was a signature move 
of Victor Nikiforov, his coach.

339
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,750
Not even Nikiforov ever 
did a jump this difficult

340
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,830
at the end of a program, 
when fatigue would be at its peak!

341
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,300
Here's a man who'll go above and 
beyond our expectations,

342
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,910
Katsuki Yuri!

343
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,360
Huh? Huh?

344
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,200
Was that a flip?

345
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,130
<i>Is he crying?</i>

346
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,590
<i>Is he mad?</i>

347
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,710
<i>Which is it?</i>

348
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,410
Victor!

349
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,970
I did great, right?

350
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,390
This was the only thing I could think of

351
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,340
to surprise you more 
than you've surprised me.

352
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,330
Really?

353
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,780
<i>In the Cup of China, 
Phichit-kun won his first gold,</i>

354
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,960
<i>and I kept Chris in check to win silver.</i>

355
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,710
Now that Yuri can do a quadruple flip,

356
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,460
he'll definitely win at the Rostelecom Cup

357
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,880
and advance to the Grand Prix Final.

358
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,650
I'm looking forward to going 
to Russia as his coach.

359
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,890
Did you hear that?

360
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,140
I'll make you into borscht in Moscow,

361
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,890
you pig bastard!

362
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,940
To Be Continued!!!

363
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,200
Say the name of the Moscow airport 
we're heading to ten times, Yuri.

364
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,790
Sheremetyevo, Sheremetyevo, 
Sheremetyevo, Sheremetyevo, Shere...

365
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,950
Next time, Eighth Skate: Yuri vs. Yuri.

366
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,290
The Horror!! Rostelecom Cup, Short Program.

367
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,840
Eighth Skate 
Yuri vs. Yuri 
The Horror!! Rostelecom Cup, Short Program

368
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,790
One step from the Grand Prix Final!

369
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,620
From Russia with love.
