1
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,940
Vitya!

2
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,450
Don't go! Stay here!

3
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,130
Yakov, you were the best coach I ever had.

4
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,100
You always will be.

5
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,330
If you walk away now, 
you can never come back!

6
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,930
Dasvidaniya.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,300
I'm sorry I can't do as you say this time.

8
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,550
You don't get to say that when you've 
never done as I said in the first place!

9
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,680
You should come visit Japan, Yakov.

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,690
Second Skate 
Two Yuris?! 
Drama at Yu-topia

11
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,160
Two Yuris?! Drama at Yu-topia!

12
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,070
Yuri! Why aren't you answering your cell?!

13
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,220
What's wrong?

14
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,980
Everything's wrong!

15
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,690
There's a rumor that Victor's
going to be Yuri's coach!

16
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,220
Oh, Vicchan's here already.

17
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,070
What?

18
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,420
Vicchan's sound asleep.

19
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,250
<i>Hello! I'm Katsuki Yuri!</i>

20
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,520
Top Certified Athletes

21
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,760
<i>I'm in a bit of a slump right now,</i>

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,960
<i>but I'm a top figure skater certified by the JSF!</i>

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,170
<i>Back home for the first time in five years,
I was thinking of how to keep my career going...</i>

24
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,760
<i>when my idol, Victor, suddenly appeared!</i>

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,980
<i>I'm still in denial that this 
is actually happening!</i>

26
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,620
<i>By the way, Victor Nikiforov is a 
living legend in figure skating.</i>

27
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,980
<i>I never dreamed he'd be interested in me, but...</i>

28
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,460
Starting today, I'm your coach.

29
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,570
I'll make you win the Grand Prix Final.

30
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,750
<i>What is he saying, standing there buck naked?</i>

31
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,820
Yuri!

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,330
Why is Victor sleeping in one of the inn's robes?!

33
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,500
He soaked in the hot spring and 
had dinner, then fell asleep...

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,050
It's big news in Russia.

35
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,880
He's taking next season off and 
is considering his next move.

36
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,110
They're also saying that when he saw
the video of you skating his routine,

37
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,020
he was struck with inspiration, and that's 
when he decided to be your coach.

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,780
Huh?

39
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,180
Victor came here because he chose you, Yuri.

40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,890
You brought him here!

41
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,630
That's incredible!

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,770
Huh?

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,530
Victor went to Japan to become 
Yuri Katsuki's coach?

44
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,280
Why that fatso?

45
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,410
Did he forget what he promised me?

46
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,020
Yakov! Where are you?

47
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,490
Explain this to me, damn it!

48
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,750
Victor wants to take time off until 
he finds his motivation again.

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,250
Personally, I doubt he'll be able to 
return if he takes a break now.

50
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,960
He's going to coach Katsuki Yuri in Japanâ€”

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,170
That man only thinks of himself!

52
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,070
He'll never be anyone's coach!

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,490
Hasetsu Hot Springs 
Yu-topia Katsuki

54
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh, he's awake.

55
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,750
I'm starving.

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,480
Hungry...

57
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,460
Huh?

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,600
He still wants to eat?

59
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,920
Um, what would you like to eat?

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,980
Hmm...

61
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,610
As your coach, I'd like to know 
what your favorite food is, Yuri.

62
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,110
What?

63
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,120
Wow! Amazing!

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,150
Our specialty, the pork cutlet bowl, extra-large!

65
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,330
Vkusno!

66
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,290
Delicious! Too good for words!

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,610
Is this what God eats?!

68
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,050
I'm glad you like it.

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,560
Yuri gains weight easily,

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,550
so he was only allowed to eat it 
when he won a competition. Right?

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,300
Oh? So have you eaten this 
pork cutlet bowl recently?

72
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,650
Yes, yes.

73
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,930
I eat it often.

74
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,270
Why?

75
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,060
You haven't won anything.

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,310
With that pig's body of yours,

77
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,060
lessons would be meaningless.

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,840
You need to get back to your weight at 
last year's Grand Prix Final, at the least...

79
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,950
or I can never coach you.

80
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,320
Until then, no more pork cutlet bowls.

81
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,070
Okay, little piggy?

82
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,340
Huh?

83
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,830
I feel like I should be offended...

84
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,830
Hey, this luggage is in the way.

85
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,580
Can you take it to the room
where I'll be staying?

86
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,960
Staying?

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,930
Wow! What a classic, tiny room.

88
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,350
Is there a sofa?

89
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,340
No...

90
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,350
I'm sorry it's so small. We only had 
an unused banquet room available.

91
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,350
You look anxious.

92
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,000
You can pay the coaching fee 
after you achieve success!

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,710
I'll bill you later.

94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,100
Th-Thank you.

95
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,400
Yuri, tell me everything about you.

96
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,530
What kind of rink do you skate at?

97
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,490
What's in this city?

98
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,490
Is there a girl you like?

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,900
Before we start practicing,

100
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,210
let's build some trust in our relationship.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,930
What? Why are you running away?

102
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,750
Uh, no reason...

103
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,750
<i>I'm still scared to be close to him.</i>

104
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,380
Yuri, let's sleep together.

105
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,260
As your coach, there's so much 
I need to learn about you.

106
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,230
No!

107
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,230
Yuri!

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,080
Yuri!

109
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,670
Yuri?

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,180
<i>We've barely ever spoken</i>

111
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,060
<i>because I always put him
on such a high pedestal,</i>

112
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>and now he's right here...</i>

113
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,940
<i>I get it now.</i>

114
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,820
<i>My heart's pounding
because of how happy I am.</i>

115
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,750
Hello!

116
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,710
Hi!

117
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm Victor Nikiforov.

118
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,210
I'll be Yuri's coach from now on.

119
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,960
Huh? What? What?!

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,460
Victor's really going to be Yuri's coach?!

121
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,510
Wow!

122
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,100
A quadruple flip!

123
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,280
Mom, I've got this!

124
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,300
I'll take the video!

125
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,560
Can I upload this?

126
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,520
It's not for the public, you skating otaku trio!

127
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,020
Seriously?

128
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,360
Yeah.

129
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,660
He says he'd like to use this rink
as our home base for now.

130
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,280
Is that okay?

131
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,920
Okay, sure!

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,270
I'll talk to the higher-ups.

133
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,140
Victor teaching you himself... 
It's like a dream come true!

134
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah...

135
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,570
<i>By the time I was twelve,</i>

136
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,750
<i>Victor, four years my senior, 
was already number one in the world.</i>

137
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,750
Junior World Championships, Gold 
Victor Nikiforov

138
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,760
<i>I've imitated him for years,
trying to catch up to him.</i>

139
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,890
<i>How could seeing the video of me 
skating his routine inspire him?</i>

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,630
<i>How did </i>I<i> inspire you, Victor?</i>

141
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,520
The little piggy can't enter the rink 
until he drops some body fat.

142
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,520
<i>Are you really serious about making me win?</i>

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,020
Okukawa Minako Ballet

144
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,020
Maybe he just wanted
an excuse to take a break.

145
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,720
Please don't say that.

146
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,900
That's what I suspect, too, but...

147
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,160
You decided to keep skating, didn't you?

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,530
You need to take advantage of Victor!

149
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,160
Okay, let's get you slimmed down!

150
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,910
O-Okay.

151
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,030
<i>Minako-sensei is a ballet instructor.</i>

152
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,090
<i>She used to travel the world as a dancer.</i>

153
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,210
<i>When I was younger,</i>

154
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,450
<i>I spent more time in her 
ballet class than at home.</i>

155
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,130
<i>I even started skating because 
Minako-sensei urged me to.</i>

156
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,880
<i>She's always cheered me on,</i>

157
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,520
<i>but she likes to meddle, too.</i>

158
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,440
Do you have feelings for Minako?

159
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,290
What?! No way!

160
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,720
Do you have a girlfriend?

161
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,320
No.

162
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,570
Any ex-girlfriends?

163
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,030
N-No comment.

164
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,140
Let's talk about me!

165
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,650
My first girlfriend wasâ€”

166
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,310
Stop!

167
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,280
Yuri, what's that castle over there?

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,300
Oh, that's Hasetsu Castle.

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,420
Inside is ninja house.

170
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,420
Really? Ninjas?!

171
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,050
Hasetsu Castle!

172
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,220
Let me see! Let me see!

173
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,800
Who's that good-looking foreigner?

174
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,000
Hashtag "#ninja"!

175
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,300
Yes!

176
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,300
What the... (lol) Victor's photo?!

177
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,550
So it's true that he's going
to be Katsuki Yuri's coach...

178
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,560
"Hasetsu Castle"?

179
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,060
Does he want to become a ninja or something?

180
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,310
I finally found you.

181
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,900
Just you wait, Victor.

182
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh?

183
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,360
Is it true that Victor is here?!

184
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,400
Comment, please!

185
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,420
Can we share a bath with him?!

186
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,740
Mari

187
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,420
Mari

188
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,660
Mari

189
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,660
It's been a long time since 
we had so many customers!

190
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,160
Congratulations on Advancing to the 
Grand Prix, Skater Katsuki Yuri

191
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,270
Victor's here, right?

192
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,540
Excuse me! We'd like to film a special feature!

193
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,110
I want to learn how to skate, too!

194
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,810
Wh-What the hell?

195
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,810
Me, too!

196
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,540
Oh...

197
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,300
Victor!

198
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,040
Oh my God! He's super hot!

199
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,900
C-Can I take a photo with you?

200
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
He's really good-looking.

201
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,050
Please let us interview you!

202
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,920
Apparently Victor's at Ice Castle.

203
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,930
Oh, wow!

204
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,810
One Week Later

205
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,060
Hasetsu City 
Hasetsu Float Statue 
Photos are best taken from right here!

206
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,450
Wow. Creepy.

207
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,740
Crap, no!

208
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,690
If I post this, Yakov will know I'm here!

209
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,160
Victor's been uploading tons of 
pictures with this city tagged...

210
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,300
Hey! Where's Victor?!

211
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,630
Victor!

212
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,210
Tiger Sweatshirt
1,300 Yen

213
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,210
Whaâ€”

214
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,020
My God...

215
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,330
That's awesome fashion!

216
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,710
Yuri!

217
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,230
Why are you in Japan, too?!

218
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,590
Oops, you found out?

219
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,340
You know how important this time 
before your senior debut is, right?!

220
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,850
I told you!

221
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm not coming back to Russia until 
Victor makes good on his promise!

222
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,660
That geezer's such a nag!

223
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,360
I have my own plan, okay?

224
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,240
<i>I'm supposed to do a triple Salchow next.</i>

225
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,620
He'd better not...

226
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
<i>I can do it!</i>

227
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,750
A quadruple Salchow?

228
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
<i>See that, Yakov?</i>

229
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,870
You idiot!

230
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,880
I told you repeatedly that quads are off-limits
because your body's still developing!

231
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,210
If you can't follow orders, then quit!

232
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,560
Yakov!

233
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,230
You should praise him more.

234
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,010
Don't butt in! It's none of your business!

235
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,520
I used to get scolded for doing that, too.

236
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,270
You can win, even without quads.

237
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,050
I'd bet money on it.

238
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,150
You can win the Junior World Championship.

239
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,900
Okay, if I win without quad jumps,

240
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,140
then choreograph a program just for me!

241
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,430
Sure.

242
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,160
When you win the Junior World
Championship, come see me.

243
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,830
I'll give you the best senior debut ever.

244
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,040
Where am I?

245
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
Victor!

246
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,490
Oh? Are you a fan of Victor's?

247
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,730
There's a skating rink below 
the castle. Try there.

248
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,980
Come on, let us watch.

249
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,650
It's reserved, and it's a 
private practice session!

250
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,060
Go home!

251
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,340
Hey! You can't go in there!

252
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,240
Huh?

253
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,990
Yuri Plisetsky!

254
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,770
He's the junior world champion...

255
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,240
Victor's inside, isn't he?

256
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,780
Come in, come in.

257
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,160
Finally here... I'm exhausted...

258
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,390
Yuri...

259
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,620
Hey, get this!

260
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,950
My weight's back to what it was
before the Grand Prix Final!

261
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,380
Now I'll finally get Victor's 
permission to skate.

262
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,450
Ow!

263
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,280
It's all your fault.

264
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,140
Apologize.

265
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,350
<i>Why is he here?</i>

266
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,310
U-Uh, sorry, sorry.

267
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,310
<i>And why's he furious at me?!</i>

268
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,970
Hey, pig!

269
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,590
Ow! That hurts! Stop!

270
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,530
The Japanese Yuri and the 
Russian Yuri are both here.

271
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,070
Fatso!

272
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,090
Pig!

273
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,850
This means...

274
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,340
We can go ahead with <i>that,</i> right?

275
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,820
Right!

276
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,380
He promised me first that he'd 
choreograph a program for me.

277
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,320
What about you?

278
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,510
Huh? We haven't gotten to talking
about programs or anything.

279
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,510
What?!

280
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,300
You make him take a whole 
year off, and to do what?

281
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,830
Isn't getting him as a coach enough?

282
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,310
As if a guy who'd sob in a toilet
stall at the Grand Prix Final

283
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,700
can change at all just by 
getting Victor as a coach!

284
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,650
<i>He's...</i>

285
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,840
Just retire already.

286
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,100
<i>He's totally underestimating me.</i>

287
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,100
Stop smirking, fatso!

288
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,100
I don't really get the whole picture, 
so you should ask him yourself.

289
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,710
<i>Victor came all the way to 
Hasetsu because he wanted to.</i>

290
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,060
<i>Just to become my coach.</i>

291
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,630
Huh?

292
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,150
Those moves...

293
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,990
They're for the short program Victor 
was practicing for next season.

294
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,810
What?

295
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,740
Victor was already putting together 
routines for next season.

296
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,220
But he was really torn.

297
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,000
Surprising the audience has 
always been his top priority.

298
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,590
He had the whole world in his hands.

299
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,210
But now, no matter what he does, 
no one's surprised anymore.

300
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,450
He knows that better than anyone.

301
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,680
If you don't have any inspiration left, 
you're as good as dead.

302
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,530
If he's going to take next season off,

303
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,940
I wonder if he'll let me use his program.

304
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,480
I know I can surprise people more.

305
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,590
I need Victor's help if I'm 
going to make my senior debut

306
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,400
and win the Grand Prix Final.

307
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,290
Huh? Win?

308
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,530
You look like you're doing great, Victor!

309
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,870
Yuri, you're here?

310
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,710
I'm surprised Yakov let you come.

311
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,890
What do you want?

312
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,560
Judging from that look,

313
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,420
I'm guessing I forgot some promise I made.

314
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,170
Welcome, Victor!
Welcome Back, Katsuki Yuri

315
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,490
Sorry, sorry.

316
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,920
I totally forgot.

317
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,260
But you knew I was the forgetful type, right?

318
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,180
Yeah, I'm painfully aware of that.

319
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,450
But a promise is a promise!

320
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,930
You'll choreograph my new program, Victor!

321
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,690
Let's go back to Russia!

322
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,690
Okay, I've decided!

323
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,080
Tomorrow, I'll choreograph 
a program for both of you

324
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,210
to the same music I'm 
using in my short program.

325
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,700
Huh?! The same music as him?!

326
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,700
What?! With the same choreography?!

327
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,180
No, this piece has several 
different arrangements.

328
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,330
I was trying to decide which one to use.

329
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,210
I'll think of a different program 
for each of you, of course.

330
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,340
I'll reveal the programs in one week!

331
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,590
You'll compete to see who can 
surprise the audience more!

332
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,290
Whoa! Let's take a step back here.

333
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,420
I don't want to be punished for losing...

334
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,050
Victor will do whatever the winner says!

335
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,100
If those are the terms, I'm in!

336
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,350
Great! I love that kind of thing!

337
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,100
Wait just a minute!

338
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,600
Will you let us organize the event?

339
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,800
A face-off between 
Yuri of Russia and Yuri of Japan!

340
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,980
Let's throw...

341
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,000
...a huge party!

342
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,120
Hasetsu Exhibition 
"Hot Springs on Ice" 
Presented by Victor Nikiforov

343
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,050
<i>One week from now, the "Hot Springs 
on Ice" show will premiere</i>

344
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
News Department

345
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,620
<i>at Ice Castle Hasetsu.</i>

346
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,380
<i>Please come to the event.</i>

347
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,130
Talk about a hovel.

348
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,520
Where's my room?

349
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,630
You're staying here?!

350
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,770
If you get Victor to yourself all 
the time, it won't be a fair match!

351
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,130
I'll stay here, too! All right?

352
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,980
It's not like you care what I think.

353
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,640
The hot spring is great.

354
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,740
I can't take a bath with other people!

355
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,390
I'm going to sleep!

356
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,710
Growl

357
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Give me food!

358
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,400
And a bath!

359
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,940
This is great!

360
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,660
The pork cutlet bowl is good, isn't it?

361
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,490
You have another visitor, Yuri?

362
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,900
Huh?

363
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,450
Huh?!

364
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,380
No way!

365
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,180
Ba-Dump

366
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,460
He looks just like my 
idol, The Blond Takao!

367
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,460
Takao?

368
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,150
His name is also Yuri.

369
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,960
What? That's confusing.

370
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,940
Okay, you're Yurio!

371
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,710
Yurio

372
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,710
What?!

373
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,700
Where will Yurio stay?

374
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,940
Upstairs inâ€”

375
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,670
The storage room?!

376
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,750
Oh, no! I need to clean it up!

377
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,470
Yuri, come help.

378
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,810
Good for you, Yurio.

379
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,720
Shut up!

380
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,220
That's not my name!

381
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,730
<i>I see...</i>

382
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,230
<i>Of course.</i>

383
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,990
<i>That Yuri has more potential than I do.</i>

384
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,990
Yuri, where are you going?

385
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,490
<i>He's pretty confident, saying he'll win the 
Grand Prix Final on his first run as a senior.</i>

386
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,750
<i>Above all, he's comfortable in front of Victor.</i>

387
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>Compared to me, he's much more...</i>

388
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,500
Huh? Where's Yuri?

389
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,850
He left a while ago.

390
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,760
At a time like this, he'd be at 
Minako-san's place or Ice Castle.

391
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,690
He's always been that way.

392
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,450
Huh? Yuri?

393
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,640
Kachu
Snack Bar

394
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,640
He's not here.

395
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,210
By "my place," she meant my ballet studio.

396
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,890
Whenever Yuri gets anxious, 
he always wants to practice.

397
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,150
I usually go along with him.

398
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,900
Ice Castle lets him skate anytime
if it's not booked already.

399
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,660
Yuri was able to grow because he had a place

400
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,290
where he could practice alone
whenever he got anxious.

401
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,750
He's no genius,

402
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,660
but he was gifted with more free time
than anyone else to practice.

403
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,410
He's always come here to practice by himself.

404
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,220
It always made me think
he really loved skating.

405
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,670
He didn't even play with his friends.

406
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,300
Well, he was never very good at making them.

407
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,550
Skating aside, he's not good
at putting himself out there.

408
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,050
I don't want this to be the end for him.

409
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,710
Me, neither.

410
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,560
He actually hates losing.

411
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,060
I hope Victor will bring out a side of 
Yuri-kun that we've never seen before.

412
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,690
So, a magic spell to change 
the little piggy into a prince...

413
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,770
Huh?

414
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,450
Nothing.

415
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,540
Thanks. I know a lot more about Yuri now.

416
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,450
Good morning.

417
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,770
Morning.

418
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,460
You say hi too, Yurio.

419
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm not Yurio!

420
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,090
Private Practice Session 
Reserved All Day 
Apologies for the Inconvenience

421
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,090
"Hot Springs on Ice" Is a Go! 
Katsuki Yuri & Yuri Plisetsky 
Location: Ice Castle Hasetsu

422
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,020
<i>Victor will finally start teaching me today.</i>

423
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,250
<i>Whether this is my last 
season or not rides on this.</i>

424
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,970
<i>I'll never win if I wimp out here!</i>

425
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,730
<i>I can't lose this "Hot Springs on Ice" match!</i>

426
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,010
<i>And then I'll aim for the Grand Prix Final!</i>

427
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,320
First, let's have you two listen to the music.

428
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,330
This piece comes in two arrangements,
each with a different theme.

429
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,830
"On Love: Eros and Agape."

430
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,200
Have you ever thought about love?

431
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,140
Nope.

432
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,090
All right.

433
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,590
Then what do you feel when 
you listen to this music?

434
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,900
It's very clear and innocent,

435
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,350
like someone who doesn't 
know what love is yet.

436
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,300
I don't like this piece.

437
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,850
This innocence crap makes me wanna barf.

438
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,600
Okay.

439
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,450
It's like a completely different song.

440
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,030
Victor!

441
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,660
I want to skate to this one!

442
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,760
The first piece is "On Love: Agape."

443
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,320
The theme is unconditional love.

444
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,570
And this piece is "On Love: Eros."

445
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,380
The theme is sexual love.

446
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,390
I'll have you two skate 
to these opposing themes.

447
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,890
This is how I'm assigning them.

448
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,390
Yuri, you'll skate to "Eros"!

449
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,890
Yurio, you'll skate to "Agape"!

450
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,650
What?!

451
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,650
Switch them! That piece isn't me at all!

452
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,730
You have to do the opposite 
of what people expect.

453
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,230
How else will you surprise them?

454
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,740
That's my motto.

455
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,970
Actually, you're both far more ordinary 
and mediocre than you think.

456
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,390
You need to be more self-aware.

457
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,030
I'm surprised you think you can
choose your own image.

458
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,920
From the audience's perspective, 
you're just a piglet and a kitten.

459
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,170
Hasetsu Exhibition 
Hot Springs on Ice 
Victor Nikiforov Presents

460
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,170
If you aren't up to my standards by next week,

461
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,670
I won't choreograph either of your programs.

462
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,930
Both of you are my fans,
so I'm sure you'll manage.

463
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,590
Fine.

464
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,930
I'll skate to "Agape."

465
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,430
My senior division debut depends on it!

466
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,690
You'd better give me a 
program that'll let me win!

467
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,240
It's up to you whether you win or not.

468
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,820
If I skated the program, I'd win for sure.

469
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,030
If I win, Victor, you're coming back to Russia.

470
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,470
And you'll be my coach!

471
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,780
That's what I want!

472
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,780
Sure.

473
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,340
Yuri, what about you?

474
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,290
What would you like to do if you win?

475
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,050
I want to eat pork cutlet
bowls with you, Victor.

476
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,550
I want to keep on winning, 
and keep on eating pork cutlet bowls!

477
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,300
So I'll skate to "Eros"!

478
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,060
I'll give it all the eros I've got!

479
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,460
Great!

481
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,230
That's exactly what I like!

482
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,980
To Be Continued!!!

483
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,860
I wonder, which of you will 
be able to satisfy me?

484
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,780
I'll satisfy you for sure!

485
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,340
Fine! Bring on the fight!

486
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,660
Don't underestimate Russia!

487
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,910
