1
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,432
Who is he?

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,227
She's Jolyne Cujoh!

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,354
Not Lang Rangler!

4
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:26,151
Should I assume that he failed,
and she's the one with the disc?

5
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:30,989
In a matter of minutes, her ally will come
and get the disc at the courtyard.

6
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:35,076
He's the chaplain of this prison.

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,203
Why is he here now?

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,164
She knows who I am.

9
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:45,170
No, she would've already attacked me
if she knew I was her enemy.

10
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,172
Wait! Please, Father!

11
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,882
Please…

12
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,009
Don't sound the alarm!

13
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,387
I'm not here to cause any trouble!

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,056
What should I do?

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,224
It would be easy to beat him unconscious.

16
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,519
That's nothing
compared to my father's life.

17
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,354
Hitting him is nothing…

18
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,026
There is already a problem.

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,530
You unlocked the door
using another inmate's work permit.

20
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,828
Where is the owner of this permit,
the inmate, Lang Rangler?

21
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,666
I know I just met you,
and I don't expect you to believe me.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,627
But I'm no liar, Father.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,254
That inmate attacked me.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,131
It was self-defense.

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,094
He's passed out in that basket over there.

26
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,306
I must report this to the authorities.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,725
I understand, Father.

28
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,686
But it has to be
after I go to the courtyard.

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,271
I only need two minutes…

30
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,899
No, give me just a single minute, Father.

31
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,277
I must go to the courtyard.
That's all I ask.

32
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,657
You want me to turn a blind eye?

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,992
It's a matter of life and death.

34
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,995
My father's life and soul depend on it.

35
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,415
A man of God should understand.

36
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,209
Are you here by yourself?

37
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,129
Is there anyone else with you?

38
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,090
No, I'm alone.

39
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,218
I lied to a chaplain.

40
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,304
But surely, a small lie can be forgiven.

41
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,057
And I can't tell him about the disc.

42
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,851
Please.

43
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,686
I only need a minute.

44
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:31,568
Doing something for others
is all an act of expecting a reward.

45
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:36,322
To be kind to others
is to expect kindness from others.

46
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,533
There is no such thing as
unconditional love.

47
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,743
Because unconditional love

48
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,247
is a reward to go to heaven.

49
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,499
You may go.

50
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,793
I will pretend I didn't see you here.

51
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,506
But only a minute as requested.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,676
You have to come back
to this gate by then.

53
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,724
I have no choice.

54
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,852
Someone is hiding behind that container.

55
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,937
If she has an ally with her,

56
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,689
I can't reveal myself.

57
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,818
I can't expose Pale Snake and kill Jolyne.

58
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,789
The Speedwagon Foundation said

59
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,335
I'll know how to hand over
the DISC once I arrive

60
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,296
once I go to the courtyard.

61
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,133
You…

62
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,470
Do you have a pass permit?

63
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,355
Seems like you don't have one.

64
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,732
You are charged with attempted escape.

65
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,443
What? What just happened?

66
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,197
I never intended to sound the alarm.

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,865
I made the right move

68
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,118
to have a prison guard
watch the courtyard.

69
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,510
EPISODE 12: TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR WARNING

70
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,388
It was 1988.

71
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,183
I befriended a man from Egypt

72
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,771
who claimed that
he had the power to stop time.

73
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,483
This man suddenly said to me…

74
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,612
There may be a way to go to heaven.

75
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,698
He was young and beautiful,

76
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,160
and yet he had the countenance
of a man who has lived for centuries.

77
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,706
I was 16 at that time.
A student advancing my studies.

78
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,794
Hey, don't make a face.

79
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,754
I'm not talking about death.

80
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:24,342
The heaven I'm talking about
pertains to our spirits.

81
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,260
The place our spirits are headed.

82
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,138
The power of our mind
must surely evolve there.

83
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,682
And ultimately where our spirits end up.

84
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,270
Surely, you understand
what I'm talking about more than anyone.

85
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,024
True happiness lies there.

86
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,027
Only if you can reach heaven.

87
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,362
I know that happiness

88
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,408
can't be obtained by having
the mightiest body, the most money,

89
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,119
or the highest status.

90
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,038
True victory

91
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,457
belongs to those who have seen heaven.

92
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,920
I will do everything to reach that end.

93
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,590
Can you be more specific?

94
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,219
I've recorded it in a notebook.

95
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,555
Come visit Egypt sometime.

96
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,474
I will show you then.

97
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,519
I will need your help

98
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,604
to test my theory.

99
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,398
However,

100
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,942
before I learned of his methods…

101
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,116
his notebook was burned to ashes.

102
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,870
The one who burned it
was Jolyne Cujoh's father,

103
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,621
Jotaro Kujo.

104
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,876
Jotaro read the contents of that notebook.

105
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,337
And he sealed its contents forever

106
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,342
along with Dio Brando
who aimed for heaven.

107
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,931
I laid in wait for over two decades

108
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,934
to gain access to Jotaro Kujo's memory.

109
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,229
The contents of the notebook
are within his memory.

110
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,902
And I finally obtained his memory

111
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,239
along with Star Platinum,
which surpassed Dio.

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,951
And now, Jotaro's body will only decay.

113
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,748
Though his daughter has acted
quite unpredictably at this prison,

114
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,460
my plan is back on schedule.

115
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,216
She got shot!

116
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,842
Jolyne got shot!

117
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,261
Who? Was it a guard?

118
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,597
Or did our enemy learn of our plan

119
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,683
and Pale Snake is lurking nearby?

120
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,481
Jolyne!

121
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,112
The guard will retrieve Star Platinum.

122
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,657
My business here is finished.

123
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,327
I shall return to the chapel.

124
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,412
What…

125
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,915
What was this thing?

126
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,250
It's a disc.

127
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,751
That's right,

128
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,213
I was ordered to retrieve this disc.

129
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:13,594
He also ordered me
to finish her off completely.

130
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,846
But whose order was it?

131
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,474
I don't remember…

132
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,984
Anyway, I received an order

133
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,655
to blow her brains out.

134
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,115
It's over.

135
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,243
There's nothing more I can do.

136
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,497
I cannot help you…

137
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,957
You're finished,

138
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,751
Jolyne Cujoh!

139
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,185
What the hell?!

140
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,147
My ability, Weather Forecast,

141
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,191
manipulates the weather.

142
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,945
This is all I can do.

143
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,530
Jolyne,

144
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,241
I may not be able to save you,

145
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,619
but I can still protect the disc.

146
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,582
And if you still have the conviction,

147
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,960
you too may be able to make it out.

148
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:40,306
Between 1887 and 1974,
in Florida alone,

149
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,641
it was reported

150
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:47,229
that more than 50 cases of fish, frogs,
snakes and sheep fell from the sky.

151
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,609
The cause is attributed
to tornadoes and whirlwinds.

152
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,319
And these are poison dart frogs,

153
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,989
which live atop the trees
of Central and South America.

154
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:03,412
It carries subcutaneous poison so deadly,
even aboriginals used them for blowguns.

155
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,421
What the hell are these frogs?!

156
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,720
These are…

157
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,847
These frogs.

158
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,767
Aren't they poison dart frogs,
known for their toxicity?

159
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,020
Once their poison enters the body,
it takes mere seconds

160
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,606
for the heart and respiratory system
to shut down.

161
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,110
That's what's splattering
along with their body fluid right now.

162
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,696
Pale Snake!

163
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,572
This ability…

164
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,826
Could it be his,
who manipulates the weather?

165
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,286
Weather Forecast.

166
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,288
He should have lost his memory.

167
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,500
Was he the one hiding behind the barrel?

168
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,753
This is bad! Card key!

169
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,986
These frogs are poisonous.

170
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,114
What happened to me?

171
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,949
Did I get shot?

172
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,242
Are the wounds deep?

173
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:28,205
The poison,
it's seeping through the threads!

174
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,667
Someone, open the gate!

175
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,710
Please!

176
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,463
Calm down.

177
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,007
I must keep my composure.

178
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,634
What do I do in such a situation?

179
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,846
Two, three, five.

180
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,805
Calm down.

181
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,723
Seven.

182
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,184
Count prime numbers and calm down.

183
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,980
Prime numbers are solitary numbers
that can only be divided by 1 and itself.

184
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,441
They give me strength.

185
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
Twenty-three.

186
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,819
Twenty-eight.

187
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,905
No, 29.

188
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,114
Dammit.

189
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,451
The frogs are covering
my 800 dollar pants!

190
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,204
Weather Forecast is in the laundry room.

191
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,121
He's too far.

192
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,124
I cannot stop this downpour of frogs.

193
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,169
I must escape.

194
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,837
Forty-one.

195
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,589
That's right.

196
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,299
The guard in the courtyard.

197
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,968
He's still under my command
by the disc. What happened to him?

198
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,971
Guard, do you hear me?

199
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,225
I order you to come here!

200
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,439
Father!

201
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,150
Help me!

202
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,487
Ask God to save me, please!

203
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,155
Forty-three.

204
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,532
Forty-seven.

205
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,699
Fifty-three.

206
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,076
Fifty-nine.

207
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,327
What a potent poison.

208
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,875
-Tell God to save me!
-So you do hear me.

209
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,670
Give me your card key!

210
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:02,132
Will I make it out?

211
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,219
Hey! Don't take it out right now, idiot!

212
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,055
Father!

213
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,270
Sixty-seven.

214
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,063
Seventy-one.

215
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,400
What is going on here?

216
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,527
These frogs…

217
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,195
I'm saved!

218
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,865
Open the gate immediately!

219
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,867
Father?

220
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,826
What's going on?

221
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,995
I don't know! A tornado, most likely.

222
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,788
Anyway, hurry it up!

223
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,706
Understood.

224
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,957
I'll open it now.

225
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,211
These frogs, they're…

226
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,796
What are you doing?

227
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,007
There's an unconscious guard on this side.

228
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,466
Hurry, open the door!

229
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,843
An unconscious guard?

230
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,679
Hold on, Father.

231
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,140
I'll get help right away!

232
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,434
Wait! Where are you going?

233
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,019
Just open this door!

234
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,478
That's it!

235
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,981
I understand,

236
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,816
but what if I need permission?

237
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902
Let me ask my superior.

238
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,988
Stay calm. Calm down, Father!

239
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,198
I am very calm.

240
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,867
The one who's not calm…

241
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,993
Seventy-three.

242
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,202
Seventy-nine.

243
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,913
…is you!

244
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,206
You dare abandon me?

245
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,459
I'll be back soon, Father!

246
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,835
Pale Snake!

247
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,546
Give me a disc!

248
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,801
I may not be able to control all of them,

249
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,095
but I can control one frog.

250
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,932
Explode after jumping ten meters.

251
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,517
I order you!

252
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,360
My eyes!

253
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,613
Save me. Father, call for help, please!

254
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,822
Father,

255
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,075
please!

256
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,534
Eighty-three.

257
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,953
Eighty-nine.

258
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,162
Ninety-seven.

259
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,373
I'm right here.

260
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,792
You believe that

261
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,294
if I leave here and call for help,

262
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,129
you could get treated right away.

263
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,341
That is what you're thinking, right?

264
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,637
Then come towards my voice.

265
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,770
Father!

266
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,774
Jotaro Kujo's disc, Star Platinum.

267
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,694
What should I do with it?

268
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,863
I have eliminated Jolyne Cujoh,
but I cannot leave her there.

269
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,616
Did the gate open?

270
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,201
Take me with you…

271
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,119
Father?

272
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,831
Where are you, Father?!

273
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,834
I'm at the end of my rope.

274
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,128
I can't guard against the the poison!

275
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,088
The disc that I let go…

276
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,424
I don't know where it is anymore!

277
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,150
The rain stopped.

278
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,739
Where is Jolyne Cujoh's corpse?

279
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,576
The disc must be close by.

280
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,995
That was vexing,

281
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,956
but my Snake would never lose to frogs.

282
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,042
Search for it.

283
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,296
Pale Snake's range is 20 meters at most.

284
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,884
It would pose a serious problem
if anyone spots me here,

285
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,344
but I'm out of options.

286
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,893
The soul of a dead criminal

287
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:46,231
returns to the earth in the form of a frog
in want of companions to the afterlife.

288
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,651
I've heard of such a legend
existing in the East.

289
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,489
Doesn't it describe
this hellish scene perfectly?

290
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,950
And the disc must be
somewhere around here.

291
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:58,994
Pale Snake.

292
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,332
Search towards the gate from there.

293
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,293
The guard might have taken it.

294
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,462
It must be within that direction.

295
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,548
I found it!

296
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,637
I've recovered the disc.

297
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,514
Thanks.

298
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
I was waiting for you to find it.

299
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,445
Goddammit.

300
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,280
It's grossing me out.

301
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,367
They're stuck on my face. Yuck.

302
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,204
The frogs splatter poison
when they hit the ground and burst.

303
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,290
If they aren't crushed, they are harmless.

304
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,710
I made a net with the living frogs

305
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,255
to lessen the impact of falling frogs.

306
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,300
And I waited for you to find the disc.

307
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,303
What a futile attempt!

308
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,558
I'll kill you, you piece of shit!

309
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,986
He was already here.

310
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,197
The envoy from
The Speedwagon Foundation, that is.

311
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,616
He wasn't even human,

312
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,660
and he came exactly on time.

313
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,706
He weaved past the rain of frogs
and reached this courtyard.

314
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,042
Savage Guardian is the name of a pigeon.

315
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,213
The trained homing pigeon
will carry the disc to the right place.

316
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,801
Pale Snake!

317
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,387
The gun the guard dropped is by the gate!

318
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,389
Shoot the pigeon down!

319
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,394
That damn guard!

320
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,229
He used up all the bullets!

321
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,147
Dammit!

322
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,026
I won.

323
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,112
Don't underestimate me!

324
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,072
Nothing has changed.

325
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,910
Even with Star Platinum,
your father is still a living mummy!

326
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:08,290
He won't even recall his own daughter!

327
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,959
Look! A guard is down!

328
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,461
Don't step on the frogs!

329
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,254
Search the courtyard!

330
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,756
Someone might be there!

331
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,553
Don't blank out yet.

332
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,764
Its Stand User must be close by.

333
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,185
I must find Pale Snake's Stand User first.

334
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:32,022
The User has my father's memory disc.

335
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,484
Now's my chance to find its User!

336
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,446
Hey! Look out the window!

337
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,405
Oh my god!

338
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,824
It's a miracle! It has to be!

339
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,327
But who's going to clean this up?

340
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,496
The tide hasn't changed.

341
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,832
I took Jotaro's Star Platinum

342
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,962
only out of my pledge
to avenge Dio, my friend.

343
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,423
The memory disc is the one that matters,

344
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,425
and it's in my hands.

345
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,552
Everything is according to plan.

346
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,596
Only Jotaro's memory

347
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,099
contains clues to attain heaven.

348
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,613
An abnormal situation where the frogs
rain only in the prison courtyard.

349
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,455
Jolyne's escape attempt
was unquestioned in this chaos.

350
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:40,674
And The Speedwagon Foundation
obtained Jotaro Kujo's Star Platinum disc.

351
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:47,055
But Jotaro's soul won't return
without the Memory disc.

352
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,068
Sports Maximum.

353
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,446
I wanted to ask you about this bone.

354
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,243
I want you to try something
using your ability.

355
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,538
Is that a human bone?

356
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,831
Whose is it?

357
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,749
That doesn't concern you.

358
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,460
Let's just say it belongs to
an old friend of mine.

359
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,088
My dear friend,

360
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,090
Dio's bone.

361
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,927
