1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,976
You three, don't take another step!

2
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,145
Step away from the water!

3
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,939
Don't try to pull anything on us.

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,275
I know one of you did this!

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:29,988
Did what?

6
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,533
The one who killed the guard
and tried to drown us!

7
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,118
I know it's one of you!

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,413
We really need to figure out who snuck in,

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,331
or we're all toast!

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,958
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,335
I said don't move.

12
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:49,174
Atroe said she didn't recognize you.

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,302
What about you two?

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,597
Do you recall seeing her from the start?

15
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,143
I don't recall your faces either.

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,730
Come on, you know I've been here
right from the start.

17
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,941
I don't remember your face.

18
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,903
Hey!
No one remembers you either, bitch.

19
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,697
I'm the one who called help
over the radio just now.

20
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,407
You could be trying to trick us.

21
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,533
Wait a second.

22
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,160
You, with the black hair.

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,120
You've got a nosebleed.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,085
What the…
I couldn't see well, but…

25
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,588
Ermes, when I punched
the enemy Stand earlier,

26
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,340
someone almost collapsed.

27
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,510
Step back.

28
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,179
Stand away from the water.

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,139
Hold on, you've got it all wrong!

30
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,518
This bitch punched my face just now!

31
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,979
Look at her! She's bleeding too.

32
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,567
What the hell?

33
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,861
Her tooth scratched my arm!

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,114
I was definitely here
right from the start.

35
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,117
The culprit is one of these two!

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,703
Listen, I remember what happened
with that crocodile warden!

37
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,124
You're the one who caused a scene!

38
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,625
She did do that.

39
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,129
You guys are just as suspicious…

40
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,799
Jolyne!

41
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,263
Was it this bitch that attacked us?

42
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,390
How did you figure it out?

43
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:24,727
Well, to be honest,
I have no clue who the killer is.

44
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,564
So I'll just beat you all up!

45
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,903
You…

46
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,531
You bitch!

47
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,533
She's…

48
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:44,747
I was going to finish you off
one by one in the water.

49
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,126
Who would've guessed

50
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,587
she had a thread ability

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,839
and would survive the attack?

52
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,341
Just what are these people?

53
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,510
They all killed him?

54
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,179
What's going on?

55
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,680
Who's the actual Stand User?

56
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,058
You're wrong.

57
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,321
One Stand User

58
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,490
for each Stand ability.

59
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,036
The women who were here from the start

60
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,455
were the black-haired
and the shaved-head one.

61
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,216
I finished them off
because they approached the tractor.

62
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,677
I then took over their body and mind.

63
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,472
This body, I created it…

64
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:49,062
using the missing inmates' flesh!

65
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:26,993
EPISODE 8: F.F.

66
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,164
The black sludge
is gathering from those two.

67
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,126
The divided parts of me
have now formed into one.

68
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:41,507
For the ability and the intellect
Pale Snake's discs have enabled me,

69
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,260
I will protect myself at any cost.

70
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,431
It is my duty

71
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,143
to eliminate those
who approach the storage shed.

72
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,394
Dammit.

73
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,813
Where is the Stand User?

74
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,607
You're misunderstanding it, Ermes.

75
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,234
He is the Stand User himself.

76
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,319
What?

77
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,030
He is an organism.

78
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,324
He is a living creature

79
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,701
who received life and power
through the discs.

80
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,163
The guard of the discs wasn't human.

81
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,998
A living creature?

82
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,460
You mean, that conglomeration
of those tiny things?

83
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,673
It must be using the water
in the bodies of its victims

84
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,677
to move on land and guard the shed.

85
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,806
It stays on land
by dividing and multiplying.

86
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,934
However, as a car needs gasoline,

87
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,894
it needs water to live.

88
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,814
To acquire the discs,

89
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,984
we need to keep this creature
out of the water and defeat it!

90
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,361
But Jolyne,

91
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:47,740
how can a tiny flea-like thing talk?

92
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,410
F.F.

93
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,620
Call me by my name!

94
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,876
An astronomer named Fred Hoyle once said,

95
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:06,467
"It is probabilistically wrong to assume
that life was born spontaneously on Earth.

96
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,014
The power of intellect
already existed in this universe,

97
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,559
and it created the origin of life."

98
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,522
Meaning intellect existed
long before the Big Bang,

99
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,901
and all substances and organisms
already possessed intellect.

100
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,613
What is he blabbering on about?

101
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,618
He's trying to say that humans
are not the only ones with intellect.

102
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,745
Even plankton have memory--

103
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,206
I told you to call me F.F.!

104
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,042
I am a being
of superior intellect than you!

105
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,044
This is bad.

106
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,339
He's trying to hide the discs
before we can get to them.

107
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,801
If he buries them underground,
we'll never be able to find them!

108
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,973
Jolyne, we're in trouble here.
Look behind you.

109
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,810
That's the creature
that attacked us from the water.

110
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,104
He's trying to drag the guard's body.

111
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,064
Remember the bracelet?

112
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,150
We must stay within 50 meters of it.

113
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,903
It's over, Jolyne.

114
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,571
Let's give up on the discs.

115
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,408
We must get the guard's body!

116
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,827
The bracelet will explode.

117
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,832
I'll leave the bracelet to you, Ermes.

118
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,044
What?

119
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,005
While I run 50 meters,

120
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,757
you protect the guard's body

121
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,010
and drag it within my safety range!

122
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,303
That's the only way!

123
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,971
Hey, I said wait!

124
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,640
What a woman.

125
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,141
She's nuts!

126
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,061
Why would she leave that to me?

127
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,024
But, dammit.

128
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,776
If it takes the guard's body,

129
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,403
then it's over for Jolyne and me.

130
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,908
I need to act now!

131
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,964
I did it, dammit.

132
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:15,137
But I'll never use the sticker
like this ever again.

133
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,559
I'll never create another arm for myself.

134
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,063
This will hurt, dammit.

135
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,822
I just have to carry him
within 50 meters of the shed…

136
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,242
Water.

137
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,500
You little worm!

138
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,471
That holler…

139
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,016
You think you've won?

140
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,940
This is the corpse
your original dried out to the bone.

141
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,151
This corpse has zero moisture.

142
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,404
My sticker has split it into two.

143
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,656
When I remove the sticker…

144
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,083
You sure absorb water like a tampon.

145
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,295
Or should I say,
a drop of water in a desert?

146
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,175
Shut up! You're in the way!

147
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,135
Scram!

148
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,767
Jolyne.

149
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,102
We need to dehydrate it.

150
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:51,817
That's the only way to win
against these tiny bastards.

151
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,670
You made it in time.

152
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,256
Either way, I will kill you two.

153
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:19,470
I was planning to ask you questions
after hiding these discs.

154
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,097
But very well.

155
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,015
Let me ask you this.

156
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,937
Will you jump into the puddle?

157
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,897
Or will you try to run?

158
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,607
Which death do you prefer?

159
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,446
I have questions as well.

160
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,740
The one who knows what you are.

161
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,493
Is it Pale Snake?

162
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,661
Also,

163
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,707
what is his aim and reason
for collecting the discs?

164
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,834
How interesting.

165
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,129
I understand the logic
behind an offensive defense.

166
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,465
And fighting to protect your friends,

167
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,094
I can't relate,
but it's also within reason.

168
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:05,558
However, I don't understand
why you'd come here to die.

169
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,602
Well, Pale Snake, was it?

170
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,605
Who knows? I've never seen him.

171
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,780
You thought I was distracted, you fool?

172
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,995
These puddles are already a part of me!

173
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,128
Did you plan to break this bag of flour

174
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,338
and absorb water?

175
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,840
Either way,

176
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,718
I fully understand my ability

177
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,721
and have created
the optimal environment for myself.

178
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,974
It may not be so bad

179
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,894
to use your body as a host for a while.

180
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,020
No.

181
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,938
You've already lost.

182
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:59,904
This environment you've created
by spilling water everywhere…

183
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,489
It will lead to your defeat.

184
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,293
You didn't even hear me
start the tractor using my threads.

185
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,921
The sound was drowned by the water.

186
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,757
You got distracted with killing me.

187
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,844
And now, you've failed to guard the discs.

188
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,889
You… Damn you!

189
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,772
I cannot allow you to have them!

190
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,818
Those discs are my…

191
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,745
The dirt in the field
is much softer than that of the wetlands.

192
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,581
Water is getting absorbed from its body.

193
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,252
And there won't be water at the end point!

194
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,800
I won't let you lay
a single finger on those discs--

195
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,388
Jolyne won this battle of wits.

196
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,391
The discs don't belong to you anymore.

197
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,979
You're finished!

198
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,148
Dry up and become feed for the crops!

199
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,154
Jolyne.

200
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,920
Jolyne, what the hell are you doing?

201
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,338
I'll give it water.

202
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,840
Let's just say,

203
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,924
I'm saving it.

204
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,342
What?

205
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,052
F.F.

206
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,307
He wasn't guarding the discs
out of loyalty to Pale Snake.

207
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,851
I know that now.

208
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,688
Though it knows its body will wither away,

209
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,899
it chased after the discs.

210
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,944
It was guarding the discs
to protect its own existence.

211
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,281
The discs gave it ability and intellect.

212
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:13,162
It risked his life for the gratitude
it has, to be able to exist.

213
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,125
It could care less about Pale Snake.

214
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,586
Hey, you want to save it?

215
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,297
It killed five people!

216
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,383
And it's literally not human!

217
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,719
If it's not human,

218
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,472
then it doesn't understand evil.

219
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,891
Pale Snake is the evil one.

220
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:38,646
Pale Snake only gave it the information
that would allow him to take advantage.

221
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,730
What?

222
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,400
And I have another reason
for saving its life.

223
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,362
I made a deal with you.

224
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,783
These discs, I want you to keep them safe.

225
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,786
But do it for us.

226
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,871
Keep them out of Pale Snake's hands.

227
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:02,503
My intention is not to take
those discs from you.

228
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,673
I only want my father's discs back.

229
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,635
And I want to know
what Pale Snake is scheming to do.

230
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,471
Well? Will you help us?

231
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,474
But no more killing humans.

232
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,893
Dammit.

233
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
You really are something.

234
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,400
I don't quite understand your feelings,

235
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,694
but I no longer feel like fighting.

236
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,447
And, I have lost… completely.

237
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,116
DISC OBTAINED

238
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,118
SUNBURN (NO CORPSE)
SHAVED-HEAD (NO CORPSE)

239
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,912
BLACK-HAIRED (BONE-DRY CORPSE)
ATROE (DEATH FROM EXPLOSION)

240
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,916
STAND NAME: F.F.
STAND MASTER: F.F.

241
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,427
So the discs really
were stored in the tire!

242
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,601
We finally found them!

243
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,478
This is Star Platinum!

244
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,440
Jolyne!

245
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,484
Are you okay? Hey!

246
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,696
I have no doubt about it.

247
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,865
This is Star Platinum's disc.

248
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,577
My father, Jotaro Kujo,
can be resuscitated with it.

249
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,620
It's finally in my hand!

250
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,792
But I don't see his memory disc.

251
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,961
Where could it be?

252
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,255
Hey.

253
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,176
If I jump out of that window,
do you think I'll die?

254
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,098
Come on, it's just me.

255
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,016
It's me!

256
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,812
F.F., just call me that.

257
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,569
I recovered whatever remained of her.

258
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,988
I wore another inmate's bracelet.

259
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,617
I want to use this body
as a host for a while.

260
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,579
This hand is useless, though.

261
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,248
Take over her life?

262
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,167
You mean,

263
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,878
you'll live in her cell as a prisoner?

264
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,379
Jolyne,

265
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,757
I want to protect you.

266
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,638
According to the memory in this body,
her name is Atroe.

267
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,141
Inmate number FE39423.

268
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,770
Her childhood dream was to get kidnapped.

269
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,733
But when she grew up,
she ended up kidnapping a child.

270
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,152
She wasn't after the ransom.

271
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,987
She doesn't know why she did it.

272
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,988
What the…

273
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,157
Your arms are bleeding.

274
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,161
Do they hurt?

275
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,705
But I can't heal them.

276
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,545
-What the hell?
-Gross!

277
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,049
Water!

278
00:18:55,384 --> 00:19:00,931
You might want to wait
on going inside the prison.

279
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,017
How about practicing
drinking from a cup first?

280
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,394
A cup?

281
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,021
That's a piece of cake!

282
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,440
Drinking from a cup is nothing.

283
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,817
Gross.

284
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,446
Hey, I wanted to ask you about Pale Snake.

285
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,949
Does he come to this shed often?

286
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,536
No, he barely swings by.

287
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,413
I've never seen his user either.

288
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,125
The discs stored here
are the ones he doesn't use.

289
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,460
No matter how strong the Stand,

290
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,006
the body rejects the disc
if you're incompatible.

291
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,010
So all the discs are
the ones he cannot use.

292
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,973
He must have another hiding place
for the important ones.

293
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,141
And that's why

294
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,977
the memory disc you're seeking
isn't in this pile.

295
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,815
What he really wanted from your father

296
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,443
wasn't an invincible Stand ability

297
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,278
but his memory.

298
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,530
It must be one hell of a secret.

299
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,157
Secret…

300
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,829
The guards are here.

301
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,249
What are you going to do, Jolyne?

302
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,543
You have the Star Platinum disc.

303
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,962
My next step

304
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,840
is to deliver this to the foundation

305
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,177
treating my father.

306
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,679
If I don't resuscitate him soon,

307
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,015
his body will begin to rot.

308
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,184
And I'll find his memory disc

309
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,978
no matter what it takes.

310
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,272
Deliver it outside of this prison.

311
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,359
It's harder to get things
out of here than in.

312
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,404
And the guards will soon
conduct a body check.

313
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,156
Let me see that disc for a sec.

314
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,537
I'll just make my boobs a bit bigger.

315
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,541
Ta-da.

316
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,048
F.F., raise your hands or you'll get shot.

317
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,967
Ermes, you too.

318
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,470
The guard was attacked by a crocodile.

319
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,806
We saved him.

320
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,101
We don't know what happened
to the other inmates.

321
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,561
That's the story we're sticking to, okay?

322
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,414
She was just bait.

323
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,376
Jolyne was just bait to attract Jotaro.

324
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,671
I believed she would be harmless.

325
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,506
Jolyne Cujoh.

326
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:44,177
Did she defeat the guard
by herself and take the discs?

327
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,597
Could it be that the surviving inmates

328
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,517
aided Jolyne?

329
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,603
Hey, it's already sundown.

330
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,064
You must return to the prison soon.

331
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,365
Are you that worried
about the missing inmates,

332
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,284
Father Pucchi?

333
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,870
A moment, please.

334
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:14,958
I will be staying here
until I give the sacrament on Sunday.

335
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:46,049
