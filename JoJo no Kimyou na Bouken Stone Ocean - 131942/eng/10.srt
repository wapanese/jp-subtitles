1
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,807
We finally found them!

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,559
This is Star Platinum!

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,394
Jolyne Cujoh.

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:24,024
Did she defeat the guard
by herself and take the discs?

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,990
I will return the disc to my father.

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,285
Along with the disc held by Pale Snake…

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,953
No matter what.

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,914
Of course.

9
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:45,003
All memories relating to myself
have been deleted from Miraschon's disc.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,506
Therefore, no one
will be able to track it to me.

11
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,509
The difference between humans and animals,

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:56,056
is that humans seek heaven.

13
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,477
Humans ought to lead a life
that leads them to heaven.

14
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:05,023
This is what makes humans beautiful.

15
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,409
EPISODE 10: OPERATION SAVAGE GUARDIAN
(HEAD TO THE COURTYARD!), PART 1

16
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,952
-Soap.
-Here's my rent.

17
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,454
I want the most expensive watch you got.

18
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,165
Move.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,334
I'm using the phone next.

20
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,711
What?

21
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,630
Are you crazy, bitch?
I'll take real good care of--

22
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,346
Take a seat! You won't get tired!

23
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,602
Here's a complimentary drink.

24
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,396
Feel free to ask me again.

25
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,078
This is The Speedwagon Foundation HQ
in Dallas, Texas.

26
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,749
We do not accept
collect calls on this number.

27
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,211
I looked up the number in a phonebook.
I only have this number.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,588
And I'm an inmate

29
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,716
at the Green Dolphin Street
State Prison in Florida.

30
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,093
My name is Jolyne Cujoh.

31
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,930
Please connect me to someone
who knows what this means.

32
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,390
Please hold.

33
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,480
Thank you for waiting.

34
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,108
Are you Professor Jotaro Kujo's daughter?

35
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,026
And you are?

36
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,695
I am just a foundation representative.

37
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,907
And I am not a Stand User.

38
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,908
I see.

39
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,661
But you seem to know
about Stand abilities.

40
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,372
Do you know about the discs?

41
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,957
Yes, of course.

42
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,795
After retrieving
Dr. Jotaro Kujo's body from the UUV,

43
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,839
he has been sheltered, not here in Dallas,

44
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,509
but somewhere safe.

45
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,138
I am so sorry to inform you of this,

46
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,518
but your father is medically unresponsive.

47
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,356
If I say that we can bring him
back to life, will you believe me?

48
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,818
I am merely a scientist. I cannot comment.

49
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,861
I have obtained a disc.

50
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,113
Just one of them.

51
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,739
We can bring him back.

52
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,742
I just know that
the discs will bring him back.

53
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,871
I'll do whatever it takes
to deliver them to you.

54
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,915
I just don't know how to do it.

55
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,712
I want you to come up
with a plan to deliver the discs there.

56
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,838
Immediately.

57
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,675
Isn't this conversation
being recorded by the prison?

58
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,803
Yes, probably.

59
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,347
But that's a risk I'm willing to take.

60
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,807
I have no time.

61
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,767
This is urgent.

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,355
I'm in a dangerous situation
where I cannot hide the disc anywhere.

63
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,900
There must be a way.

64
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,529
And just so you know,
I am not allowed visitors.

65
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,530
I understand.

66
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,574
Since you insist…

67
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,452
What about the courtyard?

68
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,661
The courtyard?

69
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,832
Do you mean the courtyard
between the men's and women's prisons?

70
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,958
Yes.

71
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,044
Please be there in 20 minutes.

72
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,254
I can manage something.

73
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,757
In 20 minutes?

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,799
From now?

75
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
Yes. You said this is urgent.

76
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,223
If you instruct us to retrieve the discs,
we will do everything we can to do so.

77
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,143
If you say he will be revived,
we believe you.

78
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,561
However,

79
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,732
we are a non-militaristic
medical research foundation.

80
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,484
We neither have the resources

81
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,488
nor the ability to help you escape
or save your life.

82
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,783
Is that risk acceptable to you?

83
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,285
Okay. I'll be there.

84
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,580
And how will you retrieve the disc?

85
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,249
We shouldn't speak of that over the phone.

86
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,212
But please look for Savage Guardian.

87
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,963
You will understand then.

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,510
Let's call it
Operation Savage Guardian for now.

89
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,391
Savage Guardian…

90
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,101
Is that an object?

91
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,644
Or is it a person?

92
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,521
Fine.

93
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,356
I need to head to the courtyard.

94
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,234
I'm at the cafeteria
of the women's prison.

95
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:45,196
To get to the courtyard,
first, I must pass through the gate,

96
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,031
go up the stairs in the back,

97
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,242
cross the second floor corridor

98
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,245
to get to the medical wing
from the women's prison.

99
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,704
You may pass.

100
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,794
FE40536, you're the nuisance
who got sent to the Punishment Ward.

101
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,464
Your access to different parts
of the facility is restricted.

102
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,226
Jolyne.

103
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,602
Emporio!

104
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,188
Here! Do not touch the ball.

105
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,488
We can't let others see us.

106
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:28,906
Come with me.

107
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,291
Wha…

108
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,009
Emporio, those two…

109
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,678
It's fine, they can be trusted.

110
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,639
He prefers to sleep on a bed,

111
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,975
but this room doesn't have one.

112
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,020
So he ends up sleeping in the piano.

113
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,782
Jolyne, I live in secret
in this ghost of a room.

114
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,326
Ghost of a room?

115
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,870
Does that mean you're…

116
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,163
No, Jolyne.

117
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,624
He and I are alive.

118
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,209
We aren't ghosts.

119
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,878
You can touch us.
We're warm and have pulses.

120
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,546
Listen closely.

121
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,510
Ghosts do not live here,
but the building itself is a ghost.

122
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,554
What?

123
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,640
Does "the ghost of objects" make sense?

124
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:41,145
This prison caught fire in 1984
and went through a huge renovation.

125
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,981
This room burned down in that fire.

126
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,485
This room belongs in the past.

127
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,278
It's a ghost of the music room.

128
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,116
So… this means… Emporio,

129
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,451
are you…

130
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,495
Ever since I was born,

131
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,331
I've been able to materialize
the ghosts of objects.

132
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,042
That's my Stand ability.

133
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,254
But I can only use them.

134
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,216
So even this chocolate bar
and this orange juice…

135
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,721
I can't consume them.

136
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,474
But they still have a taste.
They're quite good.

137
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,522
What?

138
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
Don't worry.

139
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,652
This clock stopped
when it burned along with the room.

140
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,281
You still have time
before your 20 minutes are up.

141
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,448
But…

142
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,828
you made a plan to deliver the disc
over the phone.

143
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,121
How reckless!

144
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,374
I understand your situation.

145
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,168
Pale Snake will learn about this.

146
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,629
Please, Emporio.

147
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,173
Tell me how I can reach the courtyard.

148
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,842
Don't misunderstand me.

149
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,846
I can't access just any place
from this ghost room.

150
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,641
I use the ghost items like this

151
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,561
to get around without getting caught.

152
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,564
I know you have no choice.

153
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,816
He says he wants to tag along.

154
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,486
You should take him.

155
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,779
He can aid your cause.

156
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,950
His name is Weather Forecast.

157
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
This is a music room.

158
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,588
Don't be so alarmed.

159
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,717
Weather doesn't talk much
because he has no memory.

160
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,260
-Memory?
-Yes.

161
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,890
He has no memory of his childhood
or when he arrived here.

162
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
He's serving a six-year sentence.

163
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,355
He has a habit of walking on tip-toes.

164
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,732
He's a TV guide fanatic,
but he doesn't watch TV.

165
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,777
When he talks, he barely opens his mouth.

166
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,196
And he talks right up to your face,

167
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,490
so you may feel his lukewarm breath.

168
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,533
He has no memory?

169
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,578
Is that because
Pale Snake stole them from him?

170
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,579
Probably.

171
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,874
He wants to learn about himself.

172
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:12,171
He also wants to know
why Pale Snake wants your father's discs.

173
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,722
He says his Stand ability
is not tied to the discs.

174
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,725
He was born a Stand User.

175
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,477
As for his ability…

176
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,025
he can manipulate the weather to his will.

177
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,820
His Stand name is…

178
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,282
Weather Forecast.

179
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,472
Pretend you didn't notice him.

180
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,938
Someone was peeking to see
where the music was coming from.

181
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,442
Now it's confirmed.

182
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,278
Someone knows you made a move

183
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,197
and came to check on you.

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,492
And we now know his face.

185
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,959
STAND NAME: JUMPIN' JACK SPARK
STAND MASTER: LANG RANGLER

186
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,017
Dammit. He's already close.

187
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,313
But if he's a Stand User,
we need to take care of him now!

188
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,606
No, Jolyne.

189
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,232
We should hide for now.

190
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,361
He doesn't know that
you're headed for the courtyard.

191
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,739
He didn't hear your phone call

192
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,116
and that's why came to eavesdrop!

193
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,245
If he knew, he would have
waited at the courtyard.

194
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,831
That's why, right now,

195
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,374
he's chasing us!

196
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,464
What's up with him?

197
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,384
Turn into that corner
before he gets any closer. Hurry!

198
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,321
Just as I thought.

199
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,699
He doesn't know

200
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,745
where you're going yet.

201
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,414
But what's with him?

202
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
He had a weird way of running.

203
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,587
We were able to hide because he's slow.

204
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,341
Anyway, you need to head to the courtyard.

205
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,970
Your phone call earlier
was definitely recorded,

206
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,390
but I don't think Pale Snake heard it yet.

207
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,101
The sooner you go,
the less dangerous it'll be.

208
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,353
The medical wing is up ahead.

209
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,398
Once you go downstairs
and pass the medical wing,

210
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,275
there's a gate for the corridor.

211
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,360
It leads to the factory.

212
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,280
It also leads to the men's prison
across the courtyard.

213
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,408
The medical wing is accessed
by both men and women.

214
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,743
Weather Forecast is a man,

215
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,037
so if tells a guard
he's going back to the men's prison,

216
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,957
he'll have no problem
getting to the connecting corridor

217
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,293
and getting to the factory entrance.

218
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,210
Go on ahead.

219
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,006
I need to bribe the guards, right?

220
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,924
Is 50 dollars enough?

221
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,219
Tell them you want your boots repaired
at the factory.

222
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,763
But even if you manage
to pass the medical wing,

223
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,184
you'll have to get to
the courtyard by force.

224
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,063
The security is light,
but if you get caught, they'll shoot.

225
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,066
and you'll get five more years
for trying to escape.

226
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,110
By force, huh?

227
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,529
Guess I have to get used to using it.

228
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,948
I just have to go.

229
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,453
Another five years
is nothing at this point.

230
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,079
Thank you, Emporio.

231
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,080
Right.

232
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,207
This is the most I can do.

233
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,168
Please revive him.

234
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,047
If your father comes back to life,

235
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,131
then I think

236
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,677
I might be able see some hope.

237
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,727
Oh, dammit.

238
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,771
What's wrong with this cola?

239
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,440
You touched the can, didn't you?

240
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,527
Did you shake the can?

241
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,655
Get me another one, will you?

242
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,990
Oh, I didn't touch it.

243
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,494
I only touched the plate.

244
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,289
My shoe's got a hole on it.

245
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,833
Over in the back. Can you see it?

246
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,336
I wanted to get it repaired
at the factory.

247
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,549
Oh, man, my cola spilled.

248
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,885
Where did I put that washrag?

249
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,773
"Go get a cola"?

250
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,942
You really want me to get one?

251
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,196
And you want me to pour it into this cup?

252
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,032
Do that yourself why don't you…

253
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,467
What's going on?

254
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,012
Oh, here's the washrag.

255
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,433
You can go. But make sure
to be back here in 20 minutes…

256
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,060
Oh, she already left.

257
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,813
What? Where's my cup and the plate?

258
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,983
What's happening?

259
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,526
Could it be…

260
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
This is…

261
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,701
The plate is floating!

262
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,244
The cup and the boot as well.

263
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,914
But, the contents of the cup
aren't spilling out.

264
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,125
It turns into balls of liquid and floats!

265
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,755
Everything I touch is floating upwards!

266
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,717
That money must have floated out
of that guard's pocket!

267
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,511
I'm in the air too.

268
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,182
Since when that strange guy
started chasing me...?

269
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,351
He spit at me then.

270
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,561
Did that cause this?

271
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,189
The disc!

272
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,650
Dammit. It slipped out when I rotated!

273
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,611
Stone Ocean!

274
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,239
My thread! I can't control it!

275
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,241
There is no up and down.

276
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,744
There's no gravity!

277
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,996
I'm in zero gravity!

278
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,998
You're going back to the men's prison?

279
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,251
Okay. Go ahead.

280
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,468
This is bad! He'll take my disc!

281
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,430
If I try to punch, I'll lose my balance.

282
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,307
I need to focus.

283
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,601
Aim in a single direction like a rocket!

284
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,279
What?

285
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,956
Dammit. I can't destroy this disc.

286
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,709
It just comes back like rubber.

287
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,965
That's why Pale Snake
told me to just collect it.

288
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,469
Hold on!

289
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,516
Weather Forecast,

290
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,851
don't go any further!

291
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,353
Can you hear me? I'm being attacked!

292
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,188
He took my disc.

293
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,858
If we lose him now, everything is over.

294
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,818
Everything will end!

295
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,736
Don't let him go!

296
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,572
No…

297
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,116
My voice can't reach him.

298
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,126
What a nuisance.

299
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,298
Jolyne Cujoh,
I thought I only needed to kill you.

300
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,345
Jumpin' Jack Spark!

301
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,475
Weather Forecast,
his ability takes away gravity.

302
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,437
Do not touch whatever it is he projects.

303
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,189
You'll become weightless!

304
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,858
Zero gravity.

305
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,235
So you are a Stand User yourself.

306
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,738
Surely, you understand

307
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,948
the implications of my ability.

308
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,123
He projected

309
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,834
pieces of junk.

310
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,213
Weather Forecast.

311
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,133
This man, who is said to
control the weather,

312
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,843
is a mystery to me.

313
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:24,181
But that cloud-like thing
must be a layer of air.

314
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,726
He used its resistance
to deflect the enemy's attack.

315
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,313
And he's using
centrifugal force to spin his arm.

316
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,731
It's weightless,

317
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,442
it can accelerate forever
with that spinning force.

318
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,195
His body's center of gravity won't change,

319
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,906
so he can accurately project
a powerful attack.

320
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,620
Jumpin' Jack Spark!

321
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,205
Weather Forecast!

322
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,460
This flame!

323
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,254
Aerodynamic friction?

324
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,715
Dammit, it's spreading!

325
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,592
Zero gravity, deactivate!

326
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,721
Meet your end!

327
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,431
Corridor 7B.

328
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,393
Emergency alarm activated.

329
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,563
Dammit. That impact…

330
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,857
And I have the disc, too!

331
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,527
The gate is closing.
What do I do?

332
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,071
It's even harder
to get to the courtyard now.

333
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,448
But I have no choice.

334
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,033
The enemy will be trapped too!

335
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,077
This is my chance to get back the disc!

336
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,170
What the hell?!

337
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,091
Everything you touch…

338
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,596
becomes weightless… Right?

339
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,141
Jolyne Cujoh?

340
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,203
The courtyard is just ahead.

341
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,123
But where did he go?

342
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,334
I need to get the disc back!

343
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:46,174
