1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,766
This court finds the defendant,
Jolyne Cujoh…

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,601
You're an interesting one.

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,479
So what did you do?
Why did you get thrown in?

4
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:22,981
I'm innocent.

5
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:28,737
…shall be confined to
Green Dolphin Street State Prison

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,780
for 15 years.

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,324
What is this?

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,578
Turns out you have an ability.

9
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,747
"Stone Ocean."

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,959
I'll become free
from this ocean of stones.

11
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,676
EPISODE 3: THE VISITOR (1)

12
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,969
Stone Ocean.

13
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,556
When unraveled, this thread can reach far.

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,684
However, it becomes less powerful
and inflicts less damage.

15
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,396
When it bundles, it hardens.

16
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,191
Its reach is reduced to about two meters.

17
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,529
Can I break through the bars
with Stone Ocean?

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,490
No, it lacked the strength to do so.

19
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,325
The most it could do was this.

20
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,416
My mental energy is harnessed
using the stone inside the charm.

21
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,502
I'd like to get out of here
using this power,

22
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,089
but now's not the time yet.

23
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,883
First, I need to learn

24
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,260
all I can about this place.

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,345
Hey, you.

26
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,598
I'm talking to you!

27
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,475
Sorry, but can you lend me some change?

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,062
I've got some in my room,
but the call is about to disconnect.

29
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,025
I can pay you back as soon as I'm done.
A dollar is all I need.

30
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,903
I haven't spoken to my family in a while.

31
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,280
Sure.

32
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:18,948
Here.

33
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,160
Thanks! You saved my skin!
I'll pay you back for sure!

34
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,875
Move, bitch! Don't try to cut in line!

35
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,210
Hold on!

36
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,714
I was waiting for her
to finish for 30 minutes!

37
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,633
I didn't see you waiting in line!

38
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,676
Dumbass, you must be new.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,095
You've got to reserve
these phones in advance.

40
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,680
No one told me that!

41
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,599
Well, now you know.

42
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,477
Also, the reservations
are made a month in advance.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,229
A month?

44
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:53,775
Why should I wait a whole month
for a few minutes of phone time?

45
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,319
That's what's strange
about prison, isn't it?

46
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,947
Hey, I'll buy that spot
on the phone from you.

47
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,201
And this is the cause of the phenomenon.

48
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,331
Hey, Mom!

49
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,126
I want to call her.
I need to hear her voice.

50
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,336
The voice of my mom…

51
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,171
Jolyne!

52
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,048
How do you fare?

53
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,217
Shut your trap! Keep away from me!

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,886
I already told you I'm through with you!

55
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,098
Don't push me away like that.

56
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,683
I'm giving you a warning.

57
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,978
You messed up big time just now.

58
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,979
What?

59
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,606
You just lent a dollar
to that blondie, right?

60
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,567
Get her to pay you back right now.

61
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,946
No, your life here will be over
if you don't get it back now.

62
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,157
What are you saying?
Of course, she'll pay me back.

63
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,617
It was just a dollar.

64
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,954
Hey, you said "just a dollar"!

65
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,291
You're digging your own grave
with that mentality!

66
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,208
What?

67
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,335
Listen closely, Jolyne.

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,004
At the Aquarium,

69
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,173
lending or borrowing money between inmates

70
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,884
is one thing
you should avoid at all costs.

71
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,386
Even if it's just a dollar.

72
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:08,391
Let's say that you fail
to get the dollar back.

73
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,851
You know what will happen?

74
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,770
You'll become a bottom feeder like her.

75
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:21,362
"Jolyne the newbie
couldn't even extort back her dollar."

76
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,906
The rumor will spread like wildfire

77
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,284
and you'll be the target in no time.

78
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,327
Just like her.

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,413
One after another, every single day.

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,292
Once you're out of money, you'll be forced
to give your body and even your mind.

81
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,670
Isn't that what hell on earth is like?

82
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,922
Hey, now. You're exaggerating.

83
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,926
Am I, now? It was
"just a dollar" for her at first.

84
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,137
See that blonde from earlier?

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,805
She went to her room,

86
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,391
but she's not planning on
coming down for you.

87
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,936
I'm telling you for your own sake.

88
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,784
Got a minute?

89
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,869
Oh, hello there.

90
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,913
Apparently, this one's a classic.

91
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,039
Have you read it?

92
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,499
No.

93
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,918
I'm here for the money.

94
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,463
Are you ready to pay me back?

95
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,131
Oh, of course.

96
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,759
A dollar, right? I haven't forgotten.

97
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,054
It's all in my head, don't worry about it.

98
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,972
I'll pay you back later.

99
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,517
You said you have the money in your room.

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,894
You went back, right?
Do you have it now?

101
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,563
Shut up, you bitch!

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,484
I said I'll give it back later.
I don't have it now, you hear me?

103
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,611
You a tightwad or what?

104
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:51,077
Anyway, can you lend me ten more?

105
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,998
I can call up friends on the outside
and ask for more money!

106
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,168
Please? You've got to have some on you.
Come on, don't be shy!

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,568
What's this…

108
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,533
What the heck is this?

109
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,160
I can't hold it in!

110
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,330
Hey, you in there!

111
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,916
Can you hurry it up?

112
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,627
I know you're in there!

113
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,173
I'll give you the dollar!

114
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,217
-Please!
-You'll pay me later, right?

115
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,220
Don't worry about it. Take your time.

116
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,184
I'll buy the time from you!
I'll pay five… No, ten dollars!

117
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,101
Sold!

118
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,147
Sorry. That'll be ten dollars.

119
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,327
Hey, you.

120
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,496
Go use the bathroom next.

121
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,123
Someone else will have
the urge to use it soon.

122
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,586
It's up to you whether you can get
your money back, though.

123
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,590
You're the only one who can save yourself.

124
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,179
What the… What's going on?

125
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,182
That's right, I'll be leaving soon.

126
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,642
Somehow, I'll get out.

127
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,481
Inmate number FE40536.

128
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,483
I'm returning to my cell.

129
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,026
Please unlock this door.

130
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,213
Tomorrow at noon,

131
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,091
you will have a visitor.

132
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,009
But you must not meet him.

133
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,346
You must not go to the visitation room.

134
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,847
If you do,

135
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,308
you and others will be in grave danger.

136
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,395
A fate more terrible than death
will happen.

137
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,532
Who was that just now?

138
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,367
How did a child sneak in here?

139
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,660
Hey you!

140
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,705
Didn't you hear my order to standby?

141
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,707
Do not touch the bars!

142
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,791
Stand back!

143
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,792
Open the door.

144
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,751
Right now!

145
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,796
I said do not grab the bars!

146
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,764
A visitor is coming tomorrow at noon.

147
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,474
Not to see you, though,

148
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,101
but someone in the next building,
you know what I mean?

149
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,394
That's the intel.

150
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,776
Oh, by the way,

151
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,570
you got it on backwards.

152
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,946
Your pants, I mean.

153
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,379
You're overreacting.

154
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,715
Sorry about yesterday, FE40536.

155
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,678
But it's your fault
for grabbing onto the bars like that.

156
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,346
Rules are rules.

157
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,181
I had already let go.

158
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,141
But you still hit me twice.

159
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,145
What? Did you mutter something?
Couldn't hear you.

160
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,065
Never mind. How can I help you?

161
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,900
Someone's here to see you.

162
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,363
Stand up. I'll handcuff you.

163
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,075
A visitor? Who is it, my mom?

164
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,786
How the hell should I know?
Give me your hands.

165
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,213
Stand on the mark right there.

166
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,632
I'll explain the rules.

167
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,720
You have 30 minutes.
You are allowed to hold hands,

168
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,222
but kissing or undressing are not allowed.

169
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,183
You will receive anything
they bring after the visitation.

170
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,893
Foreign languages are forbidden.

171
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,230
Depending on the visit,
the guard may choose to end it.

172
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,024
Wait there until you're authorized.

173
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,911
You mustn't go any further.

174
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,500
Turn around. Go back to your room!

175
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,627
It's not too late!

176
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,172
Who are you?

177
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,716
How did a child like you get in here?

178
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,848
I don't quite understand either,

179
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,685
but there are some things
more fearsome than death.

180
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,272
And it's happening at this very prison.

181
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,941
So please turn back. Go back to your cell!

182
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,236
No. My mom must be here to see me.

183
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,113
I want to see her.

184
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,823
She must be missing me too.

185
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,869
I need to let her know
that I'm doing well!

186
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,705
Then take this.

187
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,333
It should protect you.

188
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,337
FE40536, all right.

189
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,254
Enter!

190
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,633
These are bones!

191
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,806
Stop dawdling. Get in.

192
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,708
Jolyne, did you receive the charm
I asked your mom to give you?

193
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,878
Dad…

194
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,010
STAND NAME: STAR PLATINUM
STAND MASTER: JOTARO KUJO

195
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,724
Car and wallet theft. Assault.

196
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,144
This must be some mistake!
My Jolyne would never…

197
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,439
Since she's only 14,
she won't be charged this time.

198
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,316
You're headed to Tokyo?

199
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,361
This is your daughter we're talking about!

200
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,407
Why not go tomorrow instead?
And you call yourself her father?

201
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,826
Hello? Are you there?

202
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,342
Jolyne, are you listening?

203
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,677
Where's the pendant?

204
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,600
I'd rather receive disciplinary action.

205
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,977
Had I known it was you,
I wouldn't have come here.

206
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,147
Hey, open the door!

207
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,025
Shit, I hit him too hard.

208
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,359
Get up!

209
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,028
Good grief.

210
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,405
Jolyne, listen up.

211
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,324
It was not your boyfriend Romeo

212
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,328
who conspired to frame you for murder
and had you sent to this prison.

213
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,663
Johngalli A.

214
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,208
This man is incarcerated
in the men's prison here.

215
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,919
He's ex-military.

216
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,006
A veteran sniper who could hit his mark
under any difficult circumstance.

217
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,299
According to the report,

218
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,677
his vision has deteriorated
due to cataracts.

219
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,513
This man was behind it all.

220
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,140
Even that manslaughter accident.

221
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,645
A henchman of Johngalli A.
kidnapped an innocent hitchhiker

222
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,605
and threw him in front of the car.

223
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,400
He also hired a greedy lawyer

224
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,611
to set up the trust-fund baby.

225
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,073
Johngalli A. was pulling the strings
from this prison.

226
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,492
Help me, Jolyne!

227
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,744
Do you know what a "plea deal" is?

228
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,162
I love you!

229
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,539
This court finds the defendant,

230
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,042
-Jolyne Cujoh…
-Fifteen years…

231
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,089
Damn you! You hit me twice yesterday!

232
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,924
Dammit!

233
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,302
What's the point?

234
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:15,265
Why would he plot my imprisonment?

235
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,268
-Sit.
-Answer me!

236
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,645
I said sit.

237
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,194
Listen. Johngalli A.'s target
was you all along.

238
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,656
It's so that he can eliminate you
any time he wishes

239
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,074
within these prison walls.

240
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,409
Why is he after me?

241
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,245
Because you are my daughter.

242
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,288
You are of the Joestar bloodline.

243
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,958
Joestar?

244
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,337
The Joestar bloodline
can be traced back hundreds of decades.

245
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,549
And Johngalli A. plots to
take revenge on our family.

246
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,553
We are endowed with
the wonderful gift to move others.

247
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,055
But at times,
powerful emotions leave dregs.

248
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,516
Dregs called grudges, that is.

249
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,935
In the past,

250
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,439
I defeated a mortal enemy
of the Joestar clan.

251
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,525
Johngalli A. is a pawn of this enemy.

252
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,861
We've never met,
but I have no doubt about it.

253
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,363
Though it's been over 20 years,

254
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,701
Johngalli A. uses his fanaticism
for this man to exact his revenge.

255
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,246
I don't understand. I thought
you were just a marine biologist.

256
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,415
What's this about enemies and grudges?

257
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,418
Just know that you are being targeted.

258
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,545
I'll get you out immediately.

259
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,963
We will bypass the law.

260
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,132
Have you acquired your Stand yet?

261
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,383
"Stand"?

262
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,512
As my daughter, you are predisposed
to the ability to use this power.

263
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,849
Did you see any changes
from the pendant I gave you?

264
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,852
It seems you have.

265
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,312
That's the Stand ability.

266
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,398
Stand… Then you too?

267
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,816
Use your power to get out.

268
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,859
Okay?

269
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,447
Quit your yapping.

270
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,783
Don't try to act like a father now.

271
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,121
So you're finally here to save me.

272
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,915
What, because you love me?

273
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,126
I've already forgotten about you.

274
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,836
But fine, whatever.

275
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,215
I'll keep that shocking story
and the Stand ability in mind.

276
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,802
You can go now.

277
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,678
Don't ever visit me again.

278
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,141
My handcuffs!

279
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,601
When did I get out of them?

280
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,859
Since when…

281
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,070
The brand is different.

282
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,615
The guard didn't even approach the table.

283
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,077
Jolyne, get away from that door!

284
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,997
Star Platinum: The World!

285
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,291
Time, stop!

286
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,856
What happened just now?

287
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,316
Stay still! The fight has already begun.

288
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,616
What's the layout to the right?
Any windows in that direction?

289
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,495
Two or three. But they're all barred.

290
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,038
This is a real bullet.

291
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,584
This bullet, called a Sniper Premium,
is specific to rifles.

292
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,420
The shot was undoubtedly
taken by Johngalli A.

293
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,756
Hold on, I thought he was an inmate.

294
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,342
Inmates are prohibited
from even having pens.

295
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,053
Is that so?
But guns can be disassembled, you see.

296
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,307
Precise parts may be snuck in
through various objects.

297
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,560
Guards can be bribed by his henchmen

298
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,729
and the objects won't get searched.

299
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,565
Little by little, slowly but surely.

300
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:56,153
But we're in the women's prison!
He can't possibly shoot me from the men's!

301
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,239
We're inside a building.
There are obstructions!

302
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,950
A rifle and an ability make that possible.

303
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,204
In other words, Johngalli A. is,
without a doubt, a Stand user.

304
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,164
Look.

305
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,966
What's that?

306
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,137
Keep your distance.

307
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,140
Certainly, that's not just some rubbish.

308
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,642
But it's moving away.

309
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,393
It seems really light.

310
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,771
It's just floating in the air.

311
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,105
Don't engage it.

312
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,900
First, we must know what it can do.

313
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,738
It dodged!

314
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,198
I said don't engage it.

315
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,116
Can it see my thread?

316
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,743
Don't be so loud.

317
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,370
It's reacting to something.

318
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,580
However, not to the thread.

319
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,291
Its movement seems unrelated
to the thread.

320
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,379
Oh, could it be reacting to that?

321
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,548
What was it called?
The change in the air from the thread.

322
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,634
Like, the movement of the air?

323
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,303
Aerodynamics.

324
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,597
It detected our positions
using aerodynamics.

325
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,100
All right, so he knows our location.

326
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,686
But how can he shoot us
from the men's dormitory?

327
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,437
That's the real problem.

328
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,525
Jolyne, you were saved
by a fortuitous accident.

329
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,987
Do not make a move
until we understand the contraption.

330
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,781
Don't order me around!

331
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:28,203
-I know that!
-You… FE40536!

332
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,040
You're done for, I'll have you know!

333
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,835
Got it? Jolyne Cujoh!

334
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,548
-What?
-It's headed towards us!

335
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,634
I'll make sure you get disciplined!

336
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,927
Don't move!

337
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,639
After I beat you to death, that is!

338
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,682
Calm down!

339
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,684
Jolyne, don't leave the wall!

340
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,728
I know! And don't order me!

341
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,481
Let's knock him out
before we get into more trouble!

342
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,151
Damn you, who do you think
you're talking to?

343
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,320
You bastard!

344
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,487
Jolyne!

345
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:46,383
