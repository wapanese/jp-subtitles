EPISODE 5: PRISONER OF LOVE

2
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,151
What's this?

3
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,320
Looks like you're awake.

4
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,740
Were we dreaming just now?

5
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,119
Yes. And this substance is dissolving us.

6
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,453
In this very room.

7
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,914
Please break down the door…

8
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,917
Use your ability, Star Platinum.

9
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,045
Hurry!

10
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,262
You did it! Now drag me out!

11
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,013
Let's get out of here!

12
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,515
Hold on.

13
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,226
What did you just say?

14
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,186
Did you say "Star Platinum"?

15
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,604
That's my Stand name.

16
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,650
How do you know that, Jolyne?

17
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,443
From the looks of it,

18
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,905
we started dreaming
after I told you about Johngalli A.

19
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,407
Which means

20
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,869
you haven't seen my Stand ability yet.

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,247
Since we are related,
you may be feeling its presence,

22
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,083
but you couldn't have known its name.

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,629
It's not adding up!

24
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,258
This is

25
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,968
not reality!

26
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,105
Stone Ocean…

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,107
Jolyne.

28
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,485
You finally woke up.

29
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,904
That took too much effort.

30
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,114
My thread melts fast.

31
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,326
Jolyne… You were dreaming too.

32
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,995
I don't know about yours,

33
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,372
but mine was a terrible nightmare.

34
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,415
I see.

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,835
So we were both dreaming

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,253
as if watching a movie.

37
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,216
Guess so. It would've been perfect
if only we had some popcorn.

38
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,719
I can't move anymore. Not even a finger.

39
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,680
What about you? Can you move?

40
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,432
What we are perceiving

41
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,018
could still be a dream.

42
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,730
If you can't move at all,
then we're awake.

43
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,274
We are in this reality

44
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,109
where we can't escape this room.

45
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,027
I see.

46
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,239
We'll die at this rate.

47
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,658
The charm's ability…

48
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,953
Show me the ability you used
to wake me up.

49
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,664
Stone Ocean.

50
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,750
Yes. Can you materialize it?

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,293
I mean your power.

52
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,796
I understand, but it's no use.

53
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,131
It was hard enough to wake you up.

54
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,050
No way could I break down the door.

55
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,010
No, just materialize it.

56
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,101
That's it.

57
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,686
Keep going.

58
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,230
Can you bring it out a bit more?

59
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,025
Move it slightly towards me.

60
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,697
It'd be best if you could move it
a bit more to the left.

61
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,616
This will do.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,994
It's not ideal, but it's close enough.

63
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,205
Now we can leave this room.

64
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,927
That was my Stand, "Star Platinum."

65
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,015
Pull me out. This isn't a dream.
I'm certain of it now.

66
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,183
Damn you…

67
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,271
Bullshit…

68
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,358
It hurts and I'm pissed.

69
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,527
I can't believe you hit me.

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,572
We got out, but I'm pissed!

71
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,907
We're definitely not dreaming, all right!

72
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,211
Okay, give me your hands.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,172
What now?

74
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,469
Let's go.

75
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,137
Oh, right.

76
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,639
Do you know what this is?

77
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,143
This bone saved our lives.

78
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,728
It's a human bone.

79
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,438
Plus,

80
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,317
it's the sacrum from
the pelvic area of an adult female.

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,488
Its surface looks like
it was dissolved with some kind of acid.

82
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,864
Dissolved?

83
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,616
Is that what was used on us?

84
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,700
Can't say.

85
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,829
I don't know why you have that bone,
but it doesn't matter now.

86
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,790
I was the only one who saw that boy,

87
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,583
but he's definitely here!

88
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,544
It's a mystery,
but he's within these prison walls!

89
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,133
Code 909, emergency level 4.

90
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,803
Emergency alarm activated
in the visitation room.

91
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,263
Emergency level 4, code 909.

92
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,890
What's your plan now?

93
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,768
I guess now you're a criminal too.

94
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,561
Like I told you,

95
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,188
I'm breaking you out.

96
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,857
You have the charm, don't you?

97
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,905
It's crucial that you hold onto it.
Don't lose it, no matter what.

98
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,367
Let's go. We're leaving this place.

99
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,841
Who would have thought that
they would be able to escape this room.

100
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,139
Is it just me?
I don't see that many guards.

101
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,015
This is a common area.

102
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,601
Look at this.

103
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,690
We'll escape through the window
marked with an X.

104
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,526
This window faces the beach.

105
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,529
We'll board a submarine at the beach
to escape this island.

106
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,364
A submarine?

107
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,867
I have an amicable relationship
with a group

108
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,910
called The Speedwagon Foundation.

109
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,829
They have provided our way out.

110
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,260
There doesn't seem to be
a camera in this hallway.

111
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,971
Our target window is one left turn away.

112
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,932
Then we'll be about 20m
away from the shore.

113
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,019
I'm sure there is a lot to consider,

114
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,896
but let's get out of here first.

115
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,565
Let's go.

116
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,282
It's just the fan.

117
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,617
Jolyne.

118
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,754
It hurts!

119
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,089
Where are you looking? Stay calm.

120
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,717
Stand up.

121
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,766
What's the matter? Give me your hand.

122
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,143
It's just that…

123
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,145
Well, thanks,

124
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,397
but I can stand up by myself.

125
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,732
That's not what I meant.

126
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,110
You almost lost this.
Be careful when you trip.

127
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,947
I told you not to lose this charm.

128
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,493
What is it?

129
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,620
I told you it's important.

130
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,122
You must hold onto it. Take it.

131
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,878
You're headed to Tokyo?

132
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,048
This is your daughter we're talking about!

133
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,591
And you call yourself her father?

134
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,718
Hello? Are you there?

135
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,142
You haven't changed a bit.

136
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,229
You're calm and collected as ever.

137
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,065
When I almost died from a fever,

138
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,150
you didn't come home to check on me.

139
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,445
When I drove a car for fun
and was accused of theft,

140
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,199
you took a plane to Tokyo instead.

141
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,911
Right. As long as I'm safe,
you don't care, do you?

142
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,836
Even now, I'm just a troublemaker
that doesn't get hurt even if I fall! See?

143
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,588
Lucky me, no harm done! Yahoo!

144
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,798
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,511
If it's that important, hold it yourself!

146
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,097
Listen.

147
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,599
Shut up. I don't want it!

148
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,059
That's not it. Something is off.

149
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,646
We're being quietly followed.

150
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,523
Jolyne, duck.

151
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,750
There's no one over here.

152
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,710
They might have headed the other way.

153
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,920
Oh, it's just a guard.

154
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,341
Hey, look closely!

155
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,551
The door is bent!

156
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,846
The convicts have come this far!
We are at--

157
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,985
That's…

158
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,283
Johngalli A.!

159
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,497
That bastard…

160
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,749
He's here to finish us off himself!

161
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,585
Jolyne! Head towards the window.

162
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,003
I'll take care of him.

163
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,508
That's Johngalli A.'s Stand!

164
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,386
But the only time
he ambushed us was in a dream.

165
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,680
-Die!
-Are we still dreaming?

166
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,144
No! This is reality!

167
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,480
Time stop!

168
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,071
Our enemies…

169
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,030
There are…

170
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,282
two of them!

171
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,202
Not only did he force us to dream,

172
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,412
but he showed us

173
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,665
Johngalli A.'s actual Stand within it!

174
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,252
They had been preparing for this moment.

175
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,753
The moment

176
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,256
I have no choice
but to use my Stand ability

177
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,841
to protect my daughter!

178
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,301
Their target

179
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,095
was me all along!

180
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,847
Time will move again. Jolyne!

181
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,690
You were one move behind.

182
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,943
Jotaro Kujo, I have been waiting

183
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,737
for this moment!

184
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,999
It was just ready for me.

185
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,292
Perfect.

186
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:36,464
I finally got what I've been after
from Jotaro, the invincible Stand User!

187
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,675
This is Pale Snake's ability!

188
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,387
Those bullets!

189
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,643
The Stand!

190
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,779
How?
I thought we only saw
his Stand in our dream!

191
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,615
Anyway, while he can't shoot, I'll…

192
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,518
I see the shore! We're close!

193
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,686
Go on without me.

194
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,730
I'll catch up.

195
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,941
Were you actually…

196
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,734
shot?

197
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,656
Listen to me.
A Stand User only controls one Stand.

198
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,116
This means we are up against two enemies,

199
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,247
Johngalli A. and the one
who tried to dissolve us.

200
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,547
Go on ahead.

201
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,674
Take this charm.

202
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,633
Don't drop it.

203
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,554
A transmitter is implanted within it.

204
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,347
It's there to track your location.

205
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:14,562
The submarine is honed
to follow the GPS signal.

206
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,314
You understand what I'm saying, right?

207
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,569
All you have to do is go to the beach.
The submarine will come to you.

208
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:26,866
And The Speedwagon Foundation
I told you about will find you.

209
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,205
If you understand, then go, Jolyne.

210
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,165
This charm…

211
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,710
But earlier, you…

212
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,837
No. You couldn't have…

213
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,341
I've always cared about you.

214
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,892
What is it?

215
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,852
Your chest… You're not…

216
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,021
No, why?

217
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,106
Go, Jolyne.

218
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,066
It's just a little blood.

219
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,484
I'll catch up soon.

220
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,569
Liar!

221
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,697
Earlier, you sacrificed yourself,

222
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,949
and the enemy took something from you!

223
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,411
That's why you couldn't
evade the bullets, right?

224
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,204
What did he take?

225
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,874
Don't tell me… your Stand?

226
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,461
Jolyne!

227
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,385
What?

228
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,556
These are…

229
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,224
These threads!

230
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,142
Since when?

231
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,645
Take this!

232
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,486
Shut up.

233
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,199
We're about to leave from this window
and head for the beach.

234
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,160
Don't get in our way. Got that?

235
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,371
You…

236
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,540
When did she acquire such a Stand ability?

237
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,334
An ability of this strength

238
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,712
should have been reported
before her sentencing!

239
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,967
Very well. I will drop my gun.

240
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,438
I wasn't asking you to drop your gun.

241
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,774
I was just looking for the best angle.

242
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,902
Your body's best angle to punch, that is.

243
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,281
I only like it when your chin
is tilted slightly to the right.

244
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,992
Just now,

245
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,662
I should have finished her first
instead of Jotaro!

246
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,707
Jotaro wasn't the one
I should've gone for first.

247
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,502
Does Pale Snake know about this?

248
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,713
Jolyne Cujoh.

249
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,716
Without a doubt, she is Jotaro Kujo's…

250
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,217
She's a Joestar!

251
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,264
Jolyne.

252
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,392
Back then, in that dream…

253
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,353
you said you'll stay behind at this jail

254
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,023
for some child you barely just met.

255
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,109
He grabbed my arm
with desperation in his eyes.

256
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,111
I'm going back inside.

257
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,739
It was a mere dream I saw.

258
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,283
But…

259
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,750
Dad!

260
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,502
Dammit, we're so close to the beach!

261
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,630
Dad!

262
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,843
Find them! We have permission to shoot!

263
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,678
A guard has been shot.

264
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,305
The convict is armed.

265
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,599
We can shoot to kill!

266
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,312
Where is it? I'm at the beach already.

267
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,565
Where are they?
That organization you're friends with,

268
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,109
called The Speedwagon Foundation…

269
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,569
I don't know who they are,

270
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,989
but if they really did send us
a submarine,

271
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,952
then they must have incredibly
advanced technology and financial power!

272
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,414
A gunshot wound like this…

273
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:07,419
This foundation must be able to administer
the care you need better than anyone else!

274
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,129
Where is the submarine?

275
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,590
Where is it?

276
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,980
Everything you said was true.

277
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,441
The submarine is already at the beach!

278
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,651
We're saved…

279
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,962
What the hell are you doing?

280
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,006
You can't…

281
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,260
No, this can't be happening.

282
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,345
No, this isn't happening.

283
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,849
He was shot, but it wasn't deep.

284
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,684
It's not a fatal wound.

285
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,938
It can't be a fatal wound.

286
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,856
Then,

287
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,067
Then his heart…

288
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,572
Why isn't it beating?

289
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,747
Now, I know.

290
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,833
The Joestar blood runs in you.

291
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,336
Jolyne, with your strong conviction,

292
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,505
I know you'll be fine.

293
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,541
Found them!

294
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,044
Something's moving
on the other side of the fence!

295
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,170
Watch for the gun!

296
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,924
No, I'm not outside the fence.

297
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,967
I'm right here

298
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,636
if you're looking for me.

299
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,598
You!

300
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,724
Hold, don't shoot!

301
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,476
Her hands are up.

302
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,436
-But…
-Don't shoot!

303
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,520
She's unarmed.

304
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,689
Are you surrendering?

305
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,653
There must be another man.

306
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,822
A tall man who visited her.

307
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,908
He must be nearby. Find him!

308
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,956
That's where you were.

309
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,880
Why?

310
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,216
Why didn't you run?

311
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,427
I'm sorry,
but your father is already dead.

312
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,350
His spirit was stolen by that sludge.

313
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,395
You barely managed to survive!

314
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,523
Why didn't you leave? Why?

315
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,318
The murderer escaped inside the prison.

316
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,028
Not outside, inside!

317
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,992
The murderer had planned to steal
my father's Stand by giving it form.

318
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,951
That's his ability!

319
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,205
Then the murderer retreated
back into the prison.

320
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,832
He won't leave this place.

321
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,793
He is within these walls!

322
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,463
Are you actually trying
to get his ability back?

323
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,716
Do you think it'll bring him back to life?

324
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,051
That's precisely why
I'm going back inside.

325
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,598
I'm sorry to say this,
but a corpse will only rot away.

326
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,852
That melted bone I gave you
belonged to my mother.

327
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,520
That sludge stole her ability

328
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,855
and she died.

329
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,441
I see.

330
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,778
My mom was an inmate here
and gave birth to me.

331
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,740
I grew up in hiding within these walls.

332
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,367
What's your name?

333
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,287
I'm Emporio.

334
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,830
Emporio.

335
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,499
Your mother's bone saved my life.

336
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,126
Thank you.

337
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,468
But,

338
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,429
I can't explain it, but I'm certain of it.

339
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,182
My dad's not dead.

340
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,226
If I get his Stand back,
he will come back to life.

341
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,354
That's why

342
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,064
I'm going back!

343
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,199
You've done it.

344
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,828
You finally acquired
this powerful Stand which can stop time!

345
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,792
Yes, and I have you to thank, Johngalli A.

346
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,753
We make a great team together.

347
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,508
Please take me to the men's prison.

348
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,967
I let my guard down.

349
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:12,057
And have you seen my gun?

350
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,974
It's right here.

351
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,071
You're the only one who knows who I am.

352
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,242
You shall be my scapegoat
for the murder of the guards.

353
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,911
This way, everything works out peacefully.

354
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,456
To be able to communicate
something to someone...

355
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,544
Jotaro had said that is a wonderful thing.

356
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,962
I agree.

357
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,881
And here, we have a way.

358
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,927
