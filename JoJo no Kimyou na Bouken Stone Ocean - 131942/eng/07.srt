1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,348
His heart…

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,852
Why isn't it beating?

3
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,563
My dad's not dead.

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,108
If I can get his Stand back,
he'll surely come back to life.

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,112
I'll tell you one thing.
That power that awakened within you…

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,157
It's called a Stand ability.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,118
I have to go see her. Jolyne…

8
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,370
Jolyne Cujoh.

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,293
PUNISHMENT WARD

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,252
I see.

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,297
So Ermes has learned about Stand abilities

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,798
and about the discs too.

13
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:55,180
When Ermes inserted
McQueen's memory disc back into him,

14
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,099
he came back to life.

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,684
He was resuscitated.

16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,565
We may be able to bring your father back
if we have his discs!

17
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,278
And what did you do
with this janitor's discs?

18
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,155
I'm keeping them safe.

19
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,239
I have both discs.

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,826
She said the guards would find it

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,329
during body checks
if she brought them to her cell.

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,748
I'll hold on to his Stand ability,

23
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,043
but I'll insert
his memory disc back later.

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,381
McQueen's memory disc.

25
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,969
This disc contains memories
related to Pale Snake.

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,263
And maybe

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,724
memories of Dad's discs too.

28
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,282
It's coming!

29
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,913
Hurry, shut the door!

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,459
I was only trying to change
the tractor's tire!

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,586
I barely touched it!

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,381
Hurry!

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,093
Hurry, get out of there!

34
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,971
We need to close this door!

35
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,222
Come on, help me!

36
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,348
Okay!

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,562
It's heavy!

38
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,189
Pull harder! It's almost closed.

39
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,566
Now, pull!

40
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,654
What the hell are you doing?
I said pull harder!

41
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,659
Those aren't my arms…

42
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,660
Bro!

43
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,287
I know.

44
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,374
I was the one…

45
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,919
who didn't pull hard enough--

46
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,780
EPISODE 7: THERE'S SIX OF US!

47
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,865
Fine weather, as always.

48
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,953
Tell me, Charlotte,
what is this commotion for?

49
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,914
Why did we call this assembly?

50
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,791
This afternoon,

51
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,752
two inmates went missing
on the farm grounds.

52
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,546
Is that so?

53
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,923
That's not good.

54
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,468
The prisoners could not have
escaped from the farm grounds.

55
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,054
They must have drowned
in the surrounding wetlands

56
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,973
or gotten bitten by venomous snakes.

57
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,059
I think we need
to assemble a search party.

58
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,230
Why don't you talk about the possibility
of them being eaten by a crocodile?

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,649
Maybe a female crocodile.

60
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,235
Who was that? What did you say?!

61
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,240
I did not eat them! I am innocent!

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,702
Anyways.

63
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,415
I have called you here
to form a volunteer search party.

64
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,378
You will not be compensated,
nor will your sentence get shortened.

65
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,506
I'd like to ask for your compassion.

66
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,633
Are there any volunteers?

67
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,566
Come on, Jolyne.

68
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,735
You just got out of the Punishment Ward.

69
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,404
Why would choose to tire yourself more?

70
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,990
Because you won't be there.

71
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,618
What?
Very well.

72
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,161
A party of five is plenty.

73
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,163
Guard, bring the usual please.

74
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,291
Inmates going to the farm

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,212
must wear this
on their wrists to prevent escape.

76
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,672
"Like a Virgin."

77
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,342
Also known as "invisible wall."

78
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,930
In trying to take the bracelet cuffs off
you give it impact,

79
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,556
or if it breaks,

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,892
it will explode immediately.

81
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,978
Furthermore, if you stray
farther than 50 meters from me,

82
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,606
it will explode.

83
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,693
It would be difficult
to wipe your asses without your arms.

84
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,794
Let's go, all five of you!

85
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,050
Fifty meters?

86
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,055
We're supposed to run?

87
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,558
Wait up! Hey!

88
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,483
All right, we'll split up here
and start the search.

89
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,278
The grassy area there is a marsh.

90
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,322
There could be crocodiles, so watch out!

91
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,250
They wouldn't be here.

92
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,588
Why did you volunteer, Jolyne?

93
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,799
Well, it works well for me.

94
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,052
There are plenty of things
I have to ask you.

95
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,764
About the disc

96
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,517
and about the guy named Pale Snake.

97
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,020
Did you try it out?

98
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,482
Did you read McQueen's disc?

99
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,026
Yes, I gave it a try,

100
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,695
but it made me feel terrible.

101
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,282
It felt as if a stench
was entering my brain.

102
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,910
-Then you haven't noticed.
-What?

103
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,704
The image within the disc

104
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,500
contained clues on Pale Snake's aim.

105
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,216
McQueen.

106
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,677
This disc will suit you.

107
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,180
It's yours now.

108
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,849
This is now your Stand ability.

109
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,690
They're stored in one of
the farm tractor tires?

110
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,904
You saw a bunch of them there?

111
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,781
His aim is to collect the discs.

112
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:57,453
He was collecting Stand abilities and
memories he stole from other Stand users.

113
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,791
There are dozens of discs.

114
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,796
He has to keep them hidden from
the prison guards and other prisoners.

115
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,632
That's why he has them hidden in a tire.

116
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,803
My father's Star Platinum and memory discs

117
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,721
might be stashed there.

118
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,640
What? Father?

119
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,685
So you're searching
for your father's discs?

120
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,066
Sorry, but I don't know
anything more about him.

121
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,321
I'll look for the tractor from the disc.

122
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,538
A tractor?

123
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,667
There's a good number of them here.

124
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,007
-That shed.
-Right.

125
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,306
Hey! You two seem
to be enjoying yourselves.

126
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,933
You think this is a picnic or something?

127
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,852
You're not searching at all!

128
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,314
No, we were discussing
that shed over there.

129
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,857
We'll go search there.

130
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,318
You made us run after you on purpose.

131
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,320
Who's the one having fun here?

132
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,281
Hold it! Did you mutter something?

133
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,366
Oh, it's nothing.

134
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,787
I swore to run around
like a dog and search.

135
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,332
I don't like her.

136
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
Crocodile feces.

137
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,965
I said hold it! You disrespectful bitch!

138
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,509
I'm the guard here!

139
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,808
Oops. That was an accident.

140
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,395
The stick accidentally hit it, right?

141
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,523
What is this sound?

142
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,192
Why is my bracelet beeping?

143
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,487
That wasn't on purpose.

144
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,364
You ran into me.

145
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,367
It won't explode, will it?

146
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,118
That was a bad joke.

147
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,536
Do something about it!

148
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,539
Hey now, stay away from me.

149
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,834
What if it explodes
the moment you come near me?

150
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,252
Hold on.

151
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,630
I said I'm sorry! I'm apologizing!

152
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,050
Watch it! I said don't come near me.

153
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,513
I said, make it stop--

154
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,597
Boom!

155
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,643
Yes! That's what you get!

156
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,895
Eat crocodile shit!

157
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,075
It stopped.

158
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:45,705
Come on. Don't panic and trip, Ermes.

159
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,916
That sound was a warning.

160
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,378
Right, Mr. Prison Guard?

161
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,339
Dammit…

162
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,470
So that was your ability, huh?

163
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,017
Come on.

164
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,230
There's only a tractor
and bags of flour in here.

165
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,941
There's no point in looking inside.

166
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,237
If this was an easy assignment,
then there was no need for volunteers.

167
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,866
Seriously?

168
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,041
There it is, Jolyne!

169
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,293
It's the same tractor.

170
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,505
That's the same tractor I saw on the disc.

171
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,466
The number is the same too.

172
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,930
STAND NAME: STONE OCEAN
STAND MASTER: JOLYNE CUJOH

173
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,310
The same vehicle number. It says four.

174
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,228
They're inside that tire.

175
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,939
We can get to the discs
if we remove the tire.

176
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,649
Listen up!

177
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,902
We will now sweep the wetlands!

178
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,531
The missing inmates
could have drowned in the waters.

179
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,908
You will go look!

180
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,661
Hey, there's no way
I'm going in the water.

181
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,954
I'm not going.

182
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,664
Let's go!

183
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,709
Guess that vehicle is amphibious.

184
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,336
Give me a break.

185
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,506
Who knows what sort of disease
we'll catch in the wetlands!

186
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,299
What a pain.

187
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,259
Now's our chance.

188
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,928
Let's remove the tire now!

189
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,721
Hey, Jolyne.

190
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,016
Doesn't something seem off?

191
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,101
No, something is definitely wrong.

192
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,896
Yes, if we don't remove the tire now,

193
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,315
we would be separated from the guard.

194
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,108
No, that's not what I mean.

195
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,444
He said, "Five is plenty."

196
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,779
That Warden.

197
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,866
He said five inmates are enough.

198
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,536
but there are six of us!

199
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,455
Jolyne, what could this all mean?

200
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
Including you and I…

201
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,919
there's six of us here!

202
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,256
I know there were only
the five of us when we left.

203
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,843
But I wasn't paying attention
to how they looked.

204
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,428
Jolyne, what do you think?

205
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,264
I can't say.

206
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,724
I was fixed on catching up.

207
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,602
But then, everyone's wearing a bracelet.

208
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,396
That's strange.

209
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,482
Were there six of us

210
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,484
right from the start?

211
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,612
Hey, you think this is odd too?

212
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,242
There should've been
only five of us, right?

213
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,994
Can you tell who joined us and when?

214
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,913
No, I could be mistaken.

215
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,749
And it doesn't matter
how many of us there are.

216
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,127
She's been with me the entire time.

217
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,170
I remember her.

218
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,006
She's Atroe.

219
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,465
She gets picked on a lot.

220
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,094
She volunteered to escape the bullying.

221
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,053
Right?

222
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,431
I don't know you.

223
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,432
Hey!

224
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,019
What's going on?

225
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,271
Why is my bracelet beeping?

226
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,607
Crap, mine is too!

227
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,278
-Mine too.
-What the hell? They're all beeping.

228
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,655
We must be nearing the 50-meter limit.

229
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,949
But he can't be that far off.

230
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,661
The guard is gone!

231
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,330
Where did he go?

232
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,879
The ATV is covered in blood.

233
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,464
Why is that?

234
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,716
The bracelet won't stop beeping

235
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,511
because the guard's body
is getting farther away from us.

236
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,306
Did he fall in the water
and being washed away?

237
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,350
Find the guard!

238
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,685
He must be within 50 meters!

239
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,062
This is bad!

240
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,064
Hey.

241
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,192
My bracelet's beeping faster!

242
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,572
No way.

243
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,078
She's dead.

244
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,037
No way.

245
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,998
Did the additional person attack?

246
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,586
Is it because we got close to the discs?

247
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,715
Look 50 meters away opposite from
the girl that just exploded!

248
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,301
There he is!

249
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,720
Get near him!

250
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,557
The bracelet will stop beeping
and it won't explode either.

251
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,267
Keep your guard up, Jolyne.

252
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,853
Our enemy is among them.

253
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,522
Someone's a real psycho.

254
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,692
She looks suspicious to me.

255
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,944
The woman with the shaved head.

256
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,155
And Atroe didn't recognize her.

257
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,241
It must be her.

258
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,660
Her Stand ability must have killed him.

259
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,620
We'll kill her before she gets us!

260
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,997
Calm down, Ermes.

261
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,791
Say that the shaved woman is the culprit,

262
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:47,089
so she was guarding the discs
in the shed since before we got here?

263
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,299
That's what it would mean.

264
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,551
That's impossible.

265
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,469
She's an inmate.

266
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,514
An inmate can't keep watch 24/7.

267
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,772
Jolyne, stand back!

268
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,649
-Something's there!
-What?

269
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,234
Just step back.

270
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,777
Get away from the water!

271
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,992
Ermes.

272
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,369
-Did you see something?
-No.

273
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,332
It was nothing.

274
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,711
But I'm not getting in the marsh anymore.

275
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,588
And Jolyne.

276
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,257
We can't be separated, no matter what.

277
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,551
We don't know who the enemy is.

278
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,555
Right. And these bracelets
complicate things.

279
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,766
To take the discs from the shed,

280
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,604
we must be within 50 meters of the guard
and the other three inmates.

281
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,319
Ermes!

282
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,242
Something's in the bucket!

283
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,161
My face got sucked in!

284
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,584
What is this plankton-looking thing?

285
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,837
What?

286
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,089
It split into two.

287
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,509
No, four!

288
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,635
These creatures…

289
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,849
The bucket wasn't empty.

290
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,768
I didn't look hard enough.

291
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,562
They were already in the water.

292
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,363
Smack!

293
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,951
Ermes!

294
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,537
Jolyne, don't come in!

295
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,998
The water is not safe!
They're multiplying!

296
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,626
They can rapidly multiply.

297
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,962
Get out of the water.

298
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,006
You won't make it in time.
I fell into the Stand's trap.

299
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,343
Stone Ocean!

300
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,478
I'll get him now.

301
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,689
Jolyne.

302
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,733
You're walking on the thread?

303
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:18,240
Doesn't that mean
you're unraveling your own body?

304
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,826
Jolyne, stay away!

305
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,245
I'll take care of myself!

306
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,382
This is crazy!

307
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,845
It's true.

308
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,055
Yes, it's pretty crazy.

309
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,558
Good grief.

310
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,395
I would've been toast
if I hadn't unraveled so much thread.

311
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,731
So this is your power.

312
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,192
Her body has a hole in it.

313
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,861
She let him punch her
so she could grab onto him.

314
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,497
Jolyne, get out of the water now.

315
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,416
Don't stand up, Ermes!

316
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,375
That thing.

317
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,879
It's a bunch of small Stands
clustered together!

318
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,548
It hid inside the tiny bit
of water in the bucket,

319
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,383
and it dragged me in!

320
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,593
I know that.

321
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,970
So don't stand up.

322
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,431
Grab it underwater.

323
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,017
The thread that I'm releasing!

324
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,238
It's fast.

325
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,074
It's powerful too, but its speed...

326
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,744
Just what is it?

327
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,330
A Stand's speed and power should weaken…

328
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,499
the farther it separates from its user.

329
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,126
It got me!

330
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,544
Stay calm, Jolyne.

331
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,755
I put my sticker on it.

332
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,008
When I was caught in its arms earlier.

333
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,302
This is my Stand ability.

334
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,054
I'll peel it off now!

335
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,277
Run further inland!

336
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,375
It's not coming onto land.

337
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,378
Seems it only attacks in the water.

338
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,796
Please respond!

339
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,591
This is inmate FE32125.

340
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,926
This is an emergency.

341
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,053
The guard got in an accident.

342
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,931
Send help immediately!

343
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,726
What happened to you two?

344
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,395
It looked like you were running on water…

345
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,148
You three, don't take another step!

346
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,608
Step away from the water!

347
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,613
Don't try to pull anything on us.

348
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,116
I know one of you did this!

349
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,122
In order to obtain the discs,

350
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,542
it seems we have to defeat the User first.

351
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:46,091
