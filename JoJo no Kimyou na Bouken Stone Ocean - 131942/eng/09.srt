1
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,809
Father,

2
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,103
my incarceration has taught me

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,356
how foolish I had been in the past.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,900
I couldn't restrain my greed

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,944
and continued to steal.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,946
I'm ashamed of myself.

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,657
It's all thanks to you, Father.

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,829
Could I please ask for your assistance
in receiving parole?

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,998
Recent studies have revealed…

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,168
that proper training

11
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,629
can teach even dogs and parrots
how to read, utilize fire,

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,716
and understand art.

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,134
If that is the case,

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,179
then what is the difference
between man and animal?

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,139
What do you think?

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,932
I'm not sure.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,852
Anyway, about my parole…

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,562
Excuse me.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,858
-Hey.
-Got it.

20
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,446
The point is,

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,450
after finishing the first cherry
and leaving it in your mouth,

22
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,952
which tooth would you
bite the second with?

23
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,374
You must not bite the first pit
while eating the second cherry.

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,459
Sure…

25
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,462
And what about my parole?

26
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,633
I think there's a possibility.

27
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,176
Do you really, Father?

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,970
I will recommend you to the committee.

29
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,681
Thank you, Fa--

30
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,979
I quite like

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,066
your mischievous habit of theft.

32
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,654
Truly, an evil disposition
cannot be corrected.

33
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,571
However,

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,825
I cannot deny this talent.

35
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,285
You will prove useful to me.

36
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,122
I cannot let Jotaro's Stand

37
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,874
leave this prison, after all.

38
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,973
EPISODE 9: DEBT COLLECTOR MARY LYNN MANSON

39
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,808
What the hell?

40
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,478
What do you mean F.F. is hiding it?

41
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,857
It's an important disc
containing your father's Stand, right?

42
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,818
Are you fine with not knowing
where she's hiding it?

43
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,738
-How do we know we can--
-This place is fun!

44
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,324
-It's not like the wetlands at all!
-Really, now.

45
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,203
I want to play too.

46
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
It's called "catch," right?

47
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,375
I trust F.F.,

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,295
and Pale Snake doesn't know
that she's alive.

49
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,339
It's the safest place.

50
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,299
You're right.

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,801
But it would be even better

52
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,263
if you could deliver the disc to him.

53
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,264
I know.

54
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,977
But I'm not allowed visitors or
phone calls because I attempted to escape.

55
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,229
And I don't have a plan
to carry it out yet.

56
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,150
Hey, you!

57
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,152
That's my drink!

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,989
What's the matter with you?

59
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,241
I'm thirsty.

60
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,704
Put that cup back on the bench now!

61
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,915
If it's that important to you,
then don't put it down.

62
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,583
Especially in here.

63
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,756
F.F., I'll bring you more water!

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,925
Don't cause any trouble!

65
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,483
Give it back!

66
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,861
Oh, well.

67
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,905
I ended up with more water. Lucky me!

68
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:27,910
All right,

69
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,455
let's get back to playing.

70
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,873
-Jeez.
-What?

71
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,876
You've never thrown a ball, have you?

72
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,337
Oh, crap.

73
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,638
Tuck your hips in.

74
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,182
A bit more.

75
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,892
You got it.

76
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,062
Your form's looking better already.

77
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,106
Jolyne, did you know

78
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,360
that we've tossed the ball 86 times now?

79
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,028
We haven't dropped it at all.

80
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,654
Think we can reach a hundred?

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,075
A hundred dollars says it won't last.

82
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,703
I bet 100 dollars.

83
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,040
Sorry, but who are you?
What do you mean 100 dollars?

84
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,042
I'm Miraschon,

85
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,712
inmate FE26789.

86
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,464
I'm betting 100 dollars

87
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,885
that you won't be able to
make it to the 100th throw.

88
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,597
Where did that come from, all of a sudden?

89
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,766
I'm just killing time.

90
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,690
Let's do it!

91
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,275
We only have 13 more throws!

92
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,735
You keep quiet!

93
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,615
I don't have that kind of money.

94
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,033
I can't match this wager.

95
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,035
You can bet any item.

96
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,662
Tobacco, drugs,

97
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,706
gum, a phone call, a vibrator…

98
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,501
I'll accept anything valuable.

99
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,752
Let me be frank.

100
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,338
I'm not betting on anything.

101
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,756
Hold it.

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,091
Jolyne,

103
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,844
we should accept this bet.

104
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,429
It's a chance to make money.

105
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,681
You can use my money.

106
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,185
F.F. might suck at playing catch,
but still managed to continue to 87.

107
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,103
We can win!

108
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,771
Come on, Ermes.

109
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,691
You suspect that this is
Pale Snake's trap.

110
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,195
But I know that Miraschon
because we're on the same floor.

111
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,991
She's the greedy self-destructive type
that kept committing petty theft.

112
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,701
Think about it.

113
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,829
Even after your restrictions get lifted,

114
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,332
you need to buy your time on the phone.

115
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,917
So,

116
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,544
gonna play or not?

117
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,589
I want to give it a go! We can win this!

118
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,923
Good.

119
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,051
But you don't have 100 dollars, do you?

120
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,729
If you raise your voice or get too close,
the bet is immediately off.

121
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,646
Got it?

122
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,107
The wager has already begun.

123
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,359
But it wouldn't be fair for me

124
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,154
if you play too close
or hold onto the ball too long.

125
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,240
We'll stay at least three meters away
and throw within ten seconds.

126
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,075
Good.

127
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,830
Time to play ball! Let's go.

128
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,790
Don't rush and take your aim.

129
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,668
You have a whole ten seconds
before you throw!

130
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
Eighty-nine.

131
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,633
Only 11 more throws to go!

132
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,845
Bitch, stay away from my cup!

133
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,555
F.F.!

134
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,184
That was close.

135
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,102
Come on, focus!

136
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,229
It wasn't my fault!

137
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,815
It's her! She got near my water!

138
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,068
I'm just enjoying the show.

139
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,612
Just stay away from my cup!

140
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,572
All right.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
Five more seconds.

142
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,825
F.F., throw the ball!

143
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,203
-Damn, she's distracting me!
-Hey!

144
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,288
I'll hold your cup for you.

145
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,374
-One second left.
-F.F.!

146
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,293
Idiot!

147
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,966
Jolyne!

148
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,805
That was close, but she caught it.

149
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,682
Sorry, I panicked.

150
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,936
Be careful next time, F.F.

151
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,604
I'm fine now!

152
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,150
See? A hundred throws!

153
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,068
Good.

154
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,322
I can go another hundred throws!

155
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,408
See? An easy win.

156
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,993
Now, give us the 100 dollars.

157
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,912
Hold on, she made a wager with F.F. too.

158
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,706
That makes it 200 dollars.

159
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,375
That's true. She owes us 200 dollars.

160
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,918
Now, cough it up.

161
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,172
A thousand dollars
if you throw a hundred more.

162
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,011
You heard me.

163
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,346
I said let's play for 1,000 dollars.

164
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,806
Are you serious?

165
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,641
Do you even have that much money?

166
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,559
Of course, I do.

167
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,603
But like I said,

168
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,771
I'll take anything valuable too.

169
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,899
The rules will be the same as last time.

170
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,026
What do you say?

171
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,653
No, I'm done playing with you.

172
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,365
I'm going to be frank.

173
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,701
There's something I don't like about you.

174
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,205
-If you want to wager, go play else--
-I'll play.

175
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,832
Good.

176
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,585
F.F., hand me the glove and the ball.

177
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,711
-Okay!
-Ermes, no!

178
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,132
Jolyne, you're right, she is suspicious.

179
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,718
Especially the way she insists on betting.

180
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,636
But…

181
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,390
we can potentially make 1,200 dollars.

182
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,684
There's no way we can pass that up.

183
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,061
Be careful, though.

184
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,106
The game begins
the moment you agree to play.

185
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,900
Might be 10 seconds soon.

186
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,610
-Ermes!
-F.F.!

187
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,322
More easy money.

188
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,121
Thirty.

189
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,248
Thirty-one.

190
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,209
Thirty-two.

191
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,545
Great, the next one makes it 33.

192
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,841
Inmates, put away your exercise equipment!

193
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,010
Recess time is over!

194
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,722
Five…

195
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,392
F.F.!

196
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,393
Thirty-three!

197
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,644
Bitch!

198
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,355
What's with that attitude?!

199
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,274
Hey, this bet is off. Got that?

200
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,153
Let's say that a meteorite falls
from the skies above

201
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,656
into this yard right now.

202
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:43,828
Then, you'll persuade to end the game,

203
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,122
blaming it on the meteorite.

204
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,082
Not to convince me,

205
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,792
but yourselves.

206
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,294
Does that sit well with you, though?

207
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,673
Maybe you ran out of time

208
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,427
because you took too long
to throw the ball.

209
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,138
If you can honestly say

210
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,266
that you didn't break
the rules of the game,

211
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,143
then go ahead,

212
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,228
end this game.

213
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,146
Dammit…

214
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,480
Ermes,

215
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,066
you know you'll be thrown in
the Punishment Ward.

216
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,405
Please, mister.

217
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,574
Give me five… No, three minutes.

218
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,120
I'll make another round,
so finish up in two minutes.

219
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,705
F.F., hurry!

220
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,918
But a measly 100 dollars
only pays for the ball.

221
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,255
I'm putting the glove away. Give it to me!

222
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,591
What?

223
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,219
Goddammit!

224
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,641
Shit…

225
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,812
I attached a sticker to it

226
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,773
in case something like this happens!

227
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Ermes!

228
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,533
Whoa!

229
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,119
Let's keep playing.

230
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,042
I'm just watching.

231
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,545
I won't interfere or object.

232
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,632
And I can't prove anything, but…

233
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,093
Ermes…

234
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,221
She knows what she's done.

235
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,682
Without a doubt,

236
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,101
she violated the rules
of the game just now.

237
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,686
I know this

238
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,067
because Mary Lynn Manson,
the debt collector, appeared.

239
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,697
Ermes!

240
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,408
She's a Stand User!

241
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,834
Mary Lynn Manson
will always collect the debt

242
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,877
no matter where you hide it,

243
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,712
or what it is. All of it.

244
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,466
That's not enough.

245
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,176
Smack…

246
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,888
It's game over.

247
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,938
Ermes!

248
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,574
Ermes…

249
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,909
If I sell this liver on the black market,

250
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,372
it will compensate for
the remaining 590 dollars.

251
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,999
Bastard!

252
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,500
Take this!

253
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,298
I am the shadow of Ermes's conscience.

254
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,384
You cannot attack me.

255
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,180
Ermes broke the rules and lost the bet.

256
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,142
I only collected her debt.

257
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,061
If you have any other valuable,

258
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,189
I can exchange it for this liver.

259
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,817
The bet's not over yet.

260
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,402
What?

261
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,529
One thousand throws.

262
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,864
If I win,

263
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,575
give back everything you took from her.

264
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,535
Everything.

265
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,539
Good. However, I hope you are prepared

266
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,499
to wager something as valuable.

267
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,626
I'm aware.

268
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,960
Very well.

269
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,795
The game has already started.

270
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,672
I shall see you again.

271
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,925
F.F.!

272
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,638
Jolyne.

273
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,932
Ermer, this wasn't your fault.

274
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,851
Miraschon is a Stand User.

275
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,063
Pale Snake must have a hand in this.

276
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:44,443
She must be here to collect
my father's disc from me.

277
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,530
Then you really shouldn't play this game.

278
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,825
You got caught in
me and my father's problem.

279
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,036
I can't let you die.

280
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,997
But what are you going to do?

281
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,874
A thousand throws?

282
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,418
That Stand seems invincible.

283
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,253
You're right.

284
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,256
We'll chase Miraschon herself
and beat her!

285
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,052
The Stand may be invincible,

286
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,804
but Miraschon isn't.

287
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,306
That's why she ran.

288
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,476
Let's go!

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,444
She's here.

290
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,279
She must have entered this room.

291
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,864
There's a door to the back.

292
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,324
Maybe she escaped that way.

293
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,077
F.F.!

294
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,206
Jolyne, don't throw it yet!

295
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,086
Crap!

296
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,754
F.F.! It's coming towards you!

297
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,881
Where is it? I can't see a thing!

298
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,924
Don't move!

299
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,384
The ball will hit you!

300
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,559
Whoa! I got it!

301
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,060
That was too close!

302
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,186
Great job, F.F.

303
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,439
Now, calm down so you can throw it back.

304
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,648
I'm right here!

305
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,734
-Where are you?
-Hurry!

306
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,112
It's over for them.

307
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,156
F.F.!

308
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't have time for this!

309
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,919
F.F.

310
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,796
I shot towards

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,423
the direction of her voice.

312
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,591
I didn't even aim!

313
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,262
Dammit! What is she?

314
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,100
Lockdown will soon commence.

315
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,771
All inmates must return to their cells.

316
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,274
Prepare for headcount.

317
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,609
I repeat!

318
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,238
She ran to the right!

319
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,501
How unfortunate.

320
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,294
You can't run anymore.

321
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,255
Now that we know
that you are a Stand User,

322
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,924
I won't hold back.

323
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,258
Wait,

324
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,676
I'll give it all back.

325
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,719
The liver…

326
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,929
and the money too!

327
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,555
That's not enough.

328
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,434
Who gave you that Stand ability?

329
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,435
What?

330
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,063
Pale Snake.

331
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,358
It was him, wasn't it?
I want to know who his User is.

332
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,568
What are you talking about?

333
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,403
You shouldn't test me.

334
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,822
I'm serious!

335
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,325
I only wanted to go on parole!

336
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,791
What is this?

337
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,876
This is an elevator

338
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,504
for transporting cafeteria food.

339
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,631
How many more seconds?

340
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,924
Six…

341
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,634
No, is it five?

342
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,220
Jolyne!

343
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,978
Two seconds left…

344
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,897
F.F, the ball!

345
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,358
Throw it to me!

346
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,112
Dammit!

347
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,868
What's your next move?

348
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,787
Eight seconds left.

349
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,372
Seven, six…

350
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,087
F.F.!

351
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,848
Will this do, Miraschon?

352
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,477
Such an easy and simple request.

353
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,937
Feel free to ask me again.

354
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,490
The game of catch

355
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,118
was just interrupted.

356
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,829
It's game over,

357
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,749
Jolyne Cujoh!

358
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,961
Mary Lynn Manson
will always collect what's owed!

359
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,339
No matter where it is,

360
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,257
even if you don't know where,

361
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,301
Mary Lynn knows where it is.

362
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,344
Jolyne!

363
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,222
I'll take the most expensive organ.

364
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,932
And for the remainder,

365
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,226
your most prized possession,

366
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,645
your father's disc.

367
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,605
And the disc…

368
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:38,362
was on her since the beginning!

369
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,405
I won!

370
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,115
Your organ,

371
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,825
your disc…

372
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,286
They're all mine now!

373
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,833
The game of catch isn't over yet.

374
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,547
But how?

375
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,508
The ball…

376
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,480
Impossible.

377
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,482
-You broke the rules.
-No.

378
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,568
We never agreed on my partner.

379
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,570
The guard is okay too, right?

380
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,747
The debt collector agrees with me.

381
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,169
How many throws do I have left? Is it 800?

382
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,587
Or 900?

383
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,131
It's a pain to count.

384
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,882
Let's say 1,000 throws.

385
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,150
We did it!

386
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,575
MIRASCHON
STAND: DEBT COLLECTOR MARY LYNN MANSON

387
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,492
OUT OF COMMISSION

388
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,787
I will return the disc to my father.

389
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,458
Along with the other disc
that Pale Snake has.

390
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,709
No matter what.

391
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,966
