1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,642
5:35 P.M.

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,353
It's raining.

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,116
OCTOBER 28, 2011

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,413
It was…

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,749
always raining.

6
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,797
What the…

7
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,555
Hey, what are you making
the fuss for over there?

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,891
You're getting on my nerves!

9
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,479
I'm done for. I can't live any longer.

10
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,814
He saw me last night.

11
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,025
A male prison guard.

12
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,071
I can't live anymore!

13
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,574
Just kill me! Dammit!

14
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,618
Man, what the hell?

15
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,620
What's up with you?

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,206
What's your name again?

17
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,833
Jo… What was it?

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,419
Jolyne, was it?

19
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,755
What do you mean he saw you?

20
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,676
Well, you know, like…

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,887
The "M" word…

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,971
What?

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,600
In other words, I…

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,227
Speak up!

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,561
I'm trying to say…

26
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,315
Well, like…

27
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,402
Masturbation…

28
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,279
-What?
-What?

29
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,197
What?

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,699
-Hold on.
-I won't be able to get married now!

31
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,828
So wait, you were seen?

32
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,539
A prison guard saw you touching yourself?

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:07,085
Which guard was it?

34
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,257
I woke up before sunrise.

35
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,137
Something about the moonlight going in
through the shape of the window bars

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,347
kind of, well,

37
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,850
turned me on.

38
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,978
So, I… Yes.

39
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,940
When I came to my senses
and looked up from the bed…

40
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,860
You know that youngest guard here?

41
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,404
He had an expression of disbelief

42
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,700
as he stood right in front of this cell!

43
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,618
Just kill me!

44
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,664
I've seen him around. He's the one
that's kind of handsome, isn't he?

45
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,499
Oh, my god.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,878
So how much did he see?

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,338
I'll get to the point.

48
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,841
How low were your panties?

49
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,885
Man, you're really getting after me.

50
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,553
Like hell I'd tell you.

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,014
But I learned my lesson.

52
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,602
I'll never masturbate again ever
as long as I'm alive!

53
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,520
I swear it!

54
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,481
I don't know about that. What?

55
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,903
Man, how can you get
turned on by those bars?

56
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,863
Shut it, snotface.

57
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,283
Stop butting in like you're better!

58
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,160
As if you've never done it before.

59
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,414
I'm not dirty-minded like you lowlifes.

60
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,418
And who the hell are you?
You want to bet on who can last longer?

61
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,921
Idiot, how is that a bet?

62
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,381
Masturbation is done in secret.

63
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,301
How'd we prove that we haven't done it?

64
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:45,600
What if I told you that the joint
on your left ring finger tells all?

65
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,020
You're in here for sexual assault,
aren't you?

66
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,314
Your ring finger's discolored.

67
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,914
Inmate 21, 22, and 29.

68
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,582
You're getting transferred.

69
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,584
Standby at the bars.

70
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,087
Reach your arms out of the cell.

71
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:22,011
About the ring finger, is it true?
Some form of divination?

72
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,597
You Japanese-American?

73
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,518
You're an interesting one.

74
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,187
So what did you do?
Why did you get thrown in?

75
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,231
I'm innocent.

76
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,744
EPISODE 1: STONE OCEAN

77
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,538
You were charged.

78
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,206
For stealing and hit-and-run.

79
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,124
VISITATION ROOM

80
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,918
You were arrested
for robbery twice in the past.

81
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,586
You won't be granted parole.

82
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,171
In other words, Jojo,

83
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,175
you will be transferred
to Green Dolphin's holding cell

84
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,012
where you'll be tried at court.

85
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,472
Don't call me Jojo.

86
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,308
Only my mom calls me that.

87
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,437
And what criminal record?
I just borrowed a bike without asking.

88
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,648
I was 14 at the time!

89
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,817
Like I said, I'm innocent!

90
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,862
You better defend me at any cost.
I'm coughing up money.

91
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,074
Of course, I will do my best
for you and the law.

92
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,868
Dammit.

93
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,038
Also, when do I get to see my mom?

94
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,332
You know she's a crybaby.

95
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,125
She's a little worn out.

96
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,461
Most of all, she's worried sick about you.

97
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,671
She brought you a few things.

98
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,467
You won't have to wear a uniform
while awaiting your sentence.

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,844
Here's your clothes, book, and magazine.

100
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,888
Not to mention your homework.

101
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,684
What is this?

102
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,394
It seems to be a charm.

103
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,647
There's a tiny stone inside.

104
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,400
Your father apparently asked your mother

105
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,154
to pass it on to you
if you were ever in trouble.

106
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,989
What did you say?

107
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,366
Ow!

108
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,455
It hurts!

109
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,999
Are you okay, Jolyne?

110
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,794
What's the ruckus? Be quiet!

111
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,128
It's nothing!

112
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,963
It was just a pinch.

113
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,384
What's up with this stone?

114
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,512
Where did you hear about my dad anyway?

115
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:33,309
Your mother is attempting to contact him.
His daughter is in a crisis, after all.

116
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,858
As you know,
your father is a marine biologist.

117
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,278
He's currently somewhere in Africa
for research

118
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,447
and it's taking some time to reach him.

119
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,866
She's trying to reach him?

120
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,410
No way in hell he'll come.

121
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,619
He's…

122
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,788
That bastard…

123
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,457
I don't need this cursed charm of his!

124
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,672
What the…

125
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,094
What's the matter?

126
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,055
It's nothing. When is your next visit?

127
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,723
In two days,

128
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,893
at the visitation room of
Green Dolphin Prison's holding cell.

129
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,110
Hey, Jolyne, I thought you were innocent.

130
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,408
It's a probationary cell,
but it's still under Green Dolphin Prison.

131
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,076
If you're transferred there--

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,661
The trial will clear my name.

133
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,873
I won't go to prison.

134
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,042
We are crossing the bridge now.

135
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,919
We'll arrive in ten minutes.

136
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,629
That didn't take long.

137
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,673
Ten minutes until we're there.

138
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,885
-What? Who said that--
-I heard it from the driver's seat.

139
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,679
You can't hear them from here.

140
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,473
We're crossing the bridge now.

141
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,099
ETA is ten minutes.

142
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,142
Understood.

143
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,772
How did you know?
Is this another divination of yours?

144
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,401
Yes, it's strange, isn't it?

145
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,570
I'm not sure either.

146
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,156
You sure are a funny one.

147
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,408
I'm Ermes Costello.

148
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,036
I robbed a gas station.

149
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,122
It's my second time,
so I'll be sentenced without a doubt.

150
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,834
Nice to meet you, Ermes.

151
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,725
NOVEMBER 11, 2:32 P.M.

152
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,854
Green Dolphin Street State Prison
and the adjunct probationary cell,

153
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,273
aka "The Aquarium."

154
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,902
The premises cover 120 square kilometers.

155
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:53,533
Imprisoned here
are 708 males, 523 females,

156
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,953
and 452 minors under 18 years of age.

157
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,497
Hey Jolyne.

158
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,832
You got cash on you?

159
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,168
Maybe.

160
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,796
Hey, I'm warning you.

161
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,507
If you don't bring in a few Benjamins,

162
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,468
you might end up dead.

163
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
If you don't have any on you now,

164
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,349
make sure to have someone
bring them to you at a visitation.

165
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,936
And you're assuming
I'll be thrown in because?

166
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,230
Just giving you a heads up.

167
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,149
As if you've got cash yourself.

168
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,443
The guards would've found it
at the body search.

169
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,987
How naive, Jolyne.

170
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,322
There are tons of ways to smuggle it in.

171
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,868
You mean like sticking it up your ass
or the other hole?

172
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,453
Gross!

173
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,998
I thought that was only in the movies!

174
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,957
Dumbass,

175
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,377
that's the first place they inspect.

176
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,670
Then where?

177
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,590
Don't tell me they're in your boobs.

178
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,467
You slid some cash in
with silicone implants?

179
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,347
No way! I was kidding!

180
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,267
Jeez, you got me.

181
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,893
Don't tell a soul, though.

182
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,438
See how small the stitches?

183
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,107
It bleeds a little when I take them out,

184
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,860
but I got five 20s in one

185
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,862
and a 50 in the other.

186
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,705
We're at Green Dolphin Street Prison's
probationary cell.

187
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
Inmate 21 and 29, get off.

188
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,252
Inmate 22, Ermes Costello,

189
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,879
this isn't your stop.

190
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,571
Welcome back, Ermes Costello.
What brought you back?

191
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,115
Robbery? Assault?

192
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,367
What?

193
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,329
Did you say something to me just now?

194
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,207
Inmate 21, look straight ahead!

195
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,295
Lay it bare, Ermes.

196
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,257
You're trying to smuggle in cash, right?

197
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,929
Smuggle?
I don't know what you're talking about.

198
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,599
I hear them! Something's not right!

199
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,269
These guards can't hear them at all!

200
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,438
It's like before we crossed the bridge.

201
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,148
I can hear faraway voices!

202
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,358
Ugh!

203
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,069
This is…

204
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,532
Lay it bare, Ermes. Do it!

205
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,078
This is your second time in the Aquarium.
I know you've brought some!

206
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,872
What is this?

207
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,417
Talk is prohibited, Inmate 21!

208
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,504
Can't they see these threads
springing out of my hand?

209
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,799
Okay, I'll take them out now.

210
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,514
You know, Ermes.

211
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,060
This isn't enough to prove our friendship.

212
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,522
I bet you got more on your body somewhere.

213
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,525
Oops, the bus is braking!

214
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,451
Please let me off the hook with the 50.

215
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,329
I've got no one who's gonna come visit me.

216
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,123
Please,

217
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,002
I'll die in there without the money!

218
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,505
You got big tits for being so muscular.

219
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,924
Those tits are suspicious.

220
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,843
Let's search them.

221
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,804
Hold her still.

222
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,805
Sure.

223
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,933
No… Stop!

224
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,437
Let go!

225
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,523
Who do you think I am, bitch?

226
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,108
Take this!

227
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,213
What…

228
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,345
What just sprang out?

229
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,808
What is this… Could it be…

230
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,060
Did that stone cause this?

231
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,232
What the hell did my old man send me?!

232
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,112
NOVEMBER 8, 11 P.M.

233
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,532
Hey, remember how I tossed that charm…

234
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,449
PROBATIONARY JAIL

235
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,035
…at the visitation room?

236
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,329
I wonder where it went.

237
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,873
Who knows? I don't really remember.

238
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,626
Anyhow, let's discuss our case.

239
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,838
If you're really claiming innocence,
you need to make something clear.

240
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,842
During that hit-and-run, were you the one

241
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,386
in the driver's seat?

242
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,268
OCTOBER 28, 5:32 P.M.

243
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,312
WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA

244
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,941
So about your nickname.

245
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,779
Romeo, can I call you
"Rocchu" from now on?

246
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,738
Sure thing.

247
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,533
Only when you're gargling mouthwash.

248
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,994
What, you don't like it?

249
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,206
Why not? Rocchu, I'm hungies!

250
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,584
How about that? Fly, right?

251
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,127
No way.

252
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,212
What if my friends hear?

253
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,549
I love the way it's all lovey-dovey.

254
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,636
My mom has called me "Jojo"
ever since I was a baby.

255
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,763
I want you to call me Jojo too.

256
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,515
Hell no.

257
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,603
Anyway, I'm thirsty. Let me have a sip.

258
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,645
You can't.

259
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,939
It's a cocktail
with a 10% alcohol content!

260
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,649
It'll be fine.

261
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,736
No, you can't. I said no.

262
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,239
Romeo!

263
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,083
Romeo… Just now, we…

264
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,085
Romeo!

265
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,216
This isn't happening… No!

266
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,384
This is bad!

267
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,227
We need to get help.
Romeo, call an ambulance!

268
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,524
Jolyne, please.

269
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,194
Please don't do that. Don't call.

270
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,446
Listen to yourself! We need to help him!

271
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,115
He's already dead!

272
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,868
You're going to run? No!

273
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,829
This was an accident! And we can't run!

274
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,790
This car is the evidence!

275
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,833
Let's say the car was stolen!

276
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,960
But…

277
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,294
Jolyne!

278
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,630
Jolyne, if I'm arrested,

279
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,132
our future together is over!

280
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,718
Not to mention, I'll go to jail.

281
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,845
We'll be separated!

282
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,766
So please! Don't you love me?

283
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,685
Of course, I do.

284
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,770
But this is…

285
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,942
A car is coming.
We're finished if we're seen!

286
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,364
Jolyne! I need a hand!

287
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,951
He's dead, like I thought!

288
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,829
Please. Help me, Jolyne!

289
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,789
I love you!

290
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,502
Jolyne!

291
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,141
Jolyne, the police believe
that you were drinking and stole the car

292
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,976
then caused the accident.

293
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,937
And what is Romeo saying?

294
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
He claims his car was stolen.

295
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,192
Goddammit… I want to die!

296
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,279
Was Romeo the one driving?

297
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,282
I can't tell you that.

298
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,492
All right, then this is what we'll do.

299
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,204
Jolyne, do you know what a "plea deal" is?

300
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,333
If you admit all of your crimes,

301
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,627
they'll drop your DUI charge.

302
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,548
You'll only be sentenced
for stealing and involuntary manslaughter.

303
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,051
You'll be paroled after a year or two.

304
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,764
I told you to argue for my innocence!

305
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,975
I understand, but that's the plea bargain.

306
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,979
If the trial finds you guilty,
you'll get at least five years.

307
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,273
We don't have time, Jolyne.

308
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,319
We have to decide before the trial starts!

309
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,448
Defendant Cujoh.

310
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:59,453
Do you plead no contest of your own accord
to the contents of your plea bargain?

311
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,831
Yes, I do.

312
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:08,420
This court will consider
that the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh,

313
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,133
admits to the crime and consider
her release since the murder

314
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,344
was not premeditated.

315
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,348
However, this court cannot condone
the act of disposing of the victim,

316
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,142
who was still alive, in a swamp,

317
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,520
effectively murdering him.

318
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,396
The victim was alive?

319
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,856
What's that about?

320
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,442
What's that old man saying?

321
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,444
Murder?

322
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,831
This court sentences
the defendant, Jolyne Cujoh,

323
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,876
be confined to
Green Dolphin Street State Prison

324
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,254
for 15 years.

325
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,380
Court is adjourned.

326
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,091
What? Hold on…

327
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,010
Fifteen years? How could you?

328
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,388
I struck a deal!

329
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,348
I admitted my guilt!

330
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,351
Didn't I, Mr. Lawyer?

331
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,311
I've done all I can.

332
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,149
Take care, Jolyne Cujoh.

333
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,152
Hold it. Where are you going?

334
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,695
What are you saying?

335
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,198
Fifteen years? What's this about?
That's not what we agreed on!

336
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,116
Hold still!

337
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,536
I said hold it! You bastard!

338
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,375
You don't need to worry anymore.
The sentence has been finalized.

339
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,713
She agreed to the plea deal.
She won't be able to appeal.

340
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:37,134
There won't be any further investigations.
Congratulations, Romeo.

341
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,345
Thank you. You saved my life.

342
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,726
Please thank your rich father.

343
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,481
Romeo, you…

344
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,819
Romeo!

345
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,322
Fifteen years…

346
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,491
Fifteen years of my youth!

347
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,721
From now on, in addition to
the name your parents gave you

348
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,932
when they birthed you little shits,

349
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,143
the state will give you
an inmate number, so be grateful!

350
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,730
This prison is Category Level 4,

351
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,815
Maximum Security!

352
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,859
FE40536.

353
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,196
When you hear this number,
whether you're taking a shit or eating,

354
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,781
it's referring to you!

355
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,741
Beat that into your head!

356
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,955
FE40536, we will now conduct
a body search.

357
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,209
Throw everything you're wearing
into this tray and…

358
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,378
Strip! Begin!

359
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,173
Remember, education is the first thing
you need to do to trash.

360
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,967
Make sure to humiliate them.

361
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,718
What's taking your time?

362
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,180
"Strip" means your panties too!

363
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,683
Now, show me your ass…

364
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,851
On all fours okay?

365
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,728
Or do you want me to lie on my back?

366
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,981
Or I can do a bridge pose if you'd like.

367
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,203
You bastard…

368
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,416
How dare you just stroll out of here?!

369
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,793
It sure is humid in here.

370
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,420
My shirt is drenched.

371
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,921
It might rain.

372
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,966
Why not take a break
in the Director's office?

373
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,801
The AC is on.

374
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,553
Oh, don't inconvenience yourself.

375
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,931
All the documents have been submitted.

376
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,269
This heat is nothing
compared to my client's fate.

377
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,938
A 15-year sentence at her age…

378
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,190
If only I could have done better.

379
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,819
No, you are a spectacular lawyer.

380
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,614
Oh, speaking of your client, Jolyne Cujoh,

381
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,492
she asked me to give this letter to you.

382
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,661
The content's been cleared.

383
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,748
I see.

384
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,588
Pass this on to him too.

385
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,425
Feeling comfy? But you will keep sweating.

386
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,345
Now and forever.

387
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,554
What the hell?

388
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,601
I can't reach him right now

389
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,020
and I'm totally powerless,

390
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,230
but I'm not waiting 15 years.

391
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,149
I'll come to see you.

392
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,734
And Romeo,

393
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,363
farewell, my first love.

394
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,702
Between that dingy place and my car,

395
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,954
the air sure is different.

396
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:58,293
To think that I have to breathe
the same air as those scum with this job.

397
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,132
I can't breathe…

398
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,094
This thread… is choking my neck!

399
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,306
The AC might be drying it out!

400
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,310
I must hurry… and remove it!

401
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,951
This is another way to use it.

402
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:35,455
It reacts to my thoughts and I can
manipulate it with the force of my mind.

403
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,500
He wanted me to protect myself

404
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,169
using that charm.

405
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,841
This will be fun.

406
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,177
