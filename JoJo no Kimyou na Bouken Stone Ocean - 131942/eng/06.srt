1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,100
Green Dolphin Street Prison.

2
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,185
Also known as "The Aquarium."

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,521
At some point in time,

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,648
it had birthed mystery and power.

5
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,860
Something unseen by ordinary men.

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,239
Power and mystery drenched in filth.

7
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,163
PUNISHMENT WARD

8
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,123
Jolyne got five added years

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:44,127
for her jailbreak and has been in
the Punishment Ward for a few weeks.

10
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,337
Everything will start afterward...

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,339
Everything.

12
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,967
INFIRMARY WARD

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,763
Before that, I must investigate something.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,015
It concerns another inmate.

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,310
Her name is…

16
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,771
Ermes Costello.

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,404
Jolyne has already met her.

18
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,616
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

19
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,118
Hey! I'm talking to you, bastard!

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,584
Is this...

21
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,544
the infirmary?

22
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,434
EPISODE 6: ERMES'S STICKERS

23
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,227
Shit! That was the bathroom janitor.

24
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,646
That was my hard-earned money.

25
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,523
Dammit!

26
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,526
Oh, I'm starting to remember now.

27
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,988
I hurt my right palm.

28
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,324
I had a fever too.

29
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,160
But my hand is almost completely healed.

30
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,579
Was I dreaming?

31
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,664
Hold on.

32
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,250
It's coming back to me now.

33
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,336
Right before I got sent here

34
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,215
to serve five years
for the robbery I committed,

35
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,800
I picked up that charm.

36
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,679
It was in the washroom
of the holding cell.

37
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:47,060
But that charm cut my hand,
so I got pissed and sold it to…

38
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,812
What was her name again?

39
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,650
Oh, I think she's called Gwess.
Anyway, I sold it off to her.

40
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,027
And that night…

41
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,988
something caused me to pass out.

42
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,490
I've been held here since.

43
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,243
Have I been bedridden since?

44
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,954
My hand is better too.

45
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,878
Hold on, what just…

46
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,345
Just now, I peeled off
this sticker from my palm.

47
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,764
Is my memory okay?

48
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,601
In 1492, Columbus discovers the Americas.

49
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,729
Bugs Bunny's birthday is July 27th.

50
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,356
No, my memory's fine.

51
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,983
What the…

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,235
I'm sure I peeled it off just now.

53
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,657
Wait, what? My shoes…

54
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,493
There are…

55
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,453
One, two…

56
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,542
three, four, five, six…

57
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,211
Huh? What?

58
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,797
Ouch!

59
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,967
Ah, five of them? They're back to normal.

60
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,762
Did the high fever cause astigmatism?!

61
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,514
But that sticker just now...

62
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,102
That's the sticker I tossed aside.

63
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,187
No way…

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,691
Gross!

65
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,153
-What are you hollering about?
-Keep it down, will you?

66
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,947
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

67
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,907
Shit.

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,327
No.

69
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,580
I didn't get astigmatism from my fever.

70
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm definitely touching the shoe,
and I feel its weight.

71
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,668
This sticker…

72
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,172
When I attach it to an object,
the object is duplicated.

73
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,173
Once you peel it,

74
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,345
there's a bit of destruction,
but it merges back into one.

75
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,805
And this sticker…

76
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,683
I know it sounds crazy,
but there's no doubt about it.

77
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,520
It emerged from inside my body!

78
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,819
And

79
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,031
now that I've accepted it,
it's quite useful.

80
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,585
This is awesome.

81
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,420
No point in overthinking it.

82
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,090
This sticker emerges from my palm.

83
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,633
This is reality.

84
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,717
Asshole.

85
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,928
Give me my money back.

86
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,603
What is this…

87
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,196
He left…

88
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,491
He didn't seem to notice it.

89
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,494
I grabbed it without thinking.

90
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,080
This disc…

91
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,915
What does it do?

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,295
Your fever has gone down.

93
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,339
You may now return to your cell.

94
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,383
Well, I have a question.

95
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,094
The bathroom janitor.

96
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,012
Is he a model prisoner? What's his--

97
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,265
And what will you do
with that information?

98
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,641
Next!

99
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,601
The janitor inmate?

100
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,145
How the hell should I know?

101
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,856
No idea.

102
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,073
It's not a CD,

103
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,908
but it's shaped like one

104
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,786
and even reflects light like a disc.

105
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,081
But it's soft and elastic.

106
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,040
Also,

107
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,461
I saw another disc on his face.

108
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,504
There were two of these on him.

109
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,592
What's this? It's projecting something.

110
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,262
The money I took from the sick inmates.

111
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,346
They're mine now.

112
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,725
All 5,000 dollars.

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,643
No one will ever find them here.

114
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,770
This image…

115
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,651
McQueen.

116
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,196
Would you like to cooperate

117
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,072
as my partner?

118
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,741
McQueen!

119
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,997
What did I just see?

120
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,374
It's as if I was watching
someone's memory!

121
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,959
I heard…

122
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,838
you've been sneaking around
asking about me.

123
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,799
I've stalked before,

124
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,053
but I've never been stalked by a woman.

125
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,639
Yes, this is a first.

126
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,557
And who the hell are you?

127
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,351
I saw

128
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,728
those discs sticking out of your face!

129
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,771
Discs?

130
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,568
What?

131
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,534
I can't remember a thing! What discs?

132
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,202
I'm such a loser!

133
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,120
I can't remember a thing!

134
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,499
What got you crying all of a sudden?

135
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,418
You took my money at the infirmary.

136
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,419
Just this morning!

137
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,130
Money? That's right.

138
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,676
I had a huge sum of money,
and I hid it somewhere.

139
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,635
But…

140
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,220
I forgot where I hid it!

141
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,722
Hey, are you all right?

142
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,766
Are you messing with me?

143
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,436
Did you just ask if I'm okay?

144
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,607
How nice!

145
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,986
It's been ages since
I last spoke with a woman!

146
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,072
No, it's a first.

147
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:38,828
I've never had a heartfelt conversation
with a woman before.

148
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,497
I'm in bliss right now.

149
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,253
I hope I can spend the rest of my life
with a wonderful lady like you someday.

150
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,212
What the hell?

151
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,008
But that'll never happen.

152
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,218
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

153
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,679
Yes, I'm trash.

154
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,389
I want to die.

155
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,141
What…

156
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,728
What the hell are you doing?

157
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,608
What is this?

158
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,860
This thing!

159
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,949
STAND NAME: FREEWAY THRU HELL
STAND MASTER: THUNDER MCQUEEN

160
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,204
McQueen…

161
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,874
You have pure evil within you.

162
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,046
You have no malice or animosity.

163
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,966
You think you don't inconvenience others.

164
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,053
You victimize yourself,

165
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,013
and you have no interest in others,

166
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:43,392
yet you're always wishing
for someone to save you.

167
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,104
But that's precisely why
you are the worst.

168
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,316
You drag others down with you.

169
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,443
You are the purest form of evil.

170
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,614
I really like you, McQueen.

171
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,951
If you ever find my enemies
within these prison walls,

172
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,748
you will surely clean them out
and take care of them for me.

173
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,418
Dammit! He hanged himself...

174
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,920
and now my neck...

175
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,342
Someone!

176
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,802
Someone help!

177
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm passing out...

178
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,393
Maybe if I bring his body down,
my body will be lowered too?

179
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,270
Sticker.

180
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,533
He has strange powers like I do.

181
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,702
So there are others like me!

182
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,370
Dammit.

183
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,288
Just who the hell are you?

184
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,957
Why did you hang yourself?

185
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,043
Did you save me?

186
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,130
I owe my life to you.

187
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,133
Who the hell are you?

188
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,885
What do you want from me?

189
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,139
I know you have some sort of ability!

190
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,807
An ability?

191
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,642
I don't know what you mean.

192
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
But don't worry.

193
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,812
I won't do that again.

194
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,355
I can see clearly now.

195
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,942
And I owe you for saving my life.

196
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,486
I'll repay you someday.

197
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,448
Don't worry about that.

198
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,074
It was nothing.

199
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,953
What the hell are you doing?

200
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,875
What is this?

201
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,089
Those scars…

202
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,050
He must have suicidal tendencies!

203
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,971
And he himself is unaware of his ability.

204
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,431
This is bad.

205
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,392
I'm even in the same position as him.

206
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,353
Dammit, I'm farther away from him now.

207
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,356
You bastard!

208
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,488
Dammit!

209
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,663
The disc!

210
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,583
I don't understand what's going on,

211
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,919
but it's got to do something
with those discs!

212
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,839
Let me die.

213
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,425
I said I'd repay you,

214
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,094
but a guy like me
would never be able to do that

215
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,971
because I'm trash!

216
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't want anything to do with you!

217
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,311
Stay away from me, or I'll kill you!

218
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,230
Please do!

219
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,358
I wouldn't mind being killed
by a beautiful woman like you!

220
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:50,621
It looked like she picked up
a disc from the bathroom floor.

221
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,125
For some reason,
I think it belonged to me.

222
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,919
I wonder if she'll give it back.

223
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,297
No, probably not.

224
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,799
Let me pass!

225
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,761
I have permission to leave.
I'm returning to the women's prison.

226
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,139
Dammit!

227
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,059
I need to get as far away
from that psycho as possible.

228
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,936
I need to get back

229
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,604
to my cell.

230
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,821
I knew it.

231
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,948
So your powers have awakened.

232
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,579
I'll tell you one thing.
That power that awakened within you…

233
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,790
It's called a Stand ability.

234
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,754
Stand abilities are drawn
to one another like gravity.

235
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,172
It happens without reason.

236
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,218
That's why you ran into that janitor.

237
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,470
Why is there a kid?!

238
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,474
You picked up and sold Jolyne's charm.

239
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:58,397
That's why she told me
to keep an eye on you.

240
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,857
You know Jolyne?

241
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,484
What happened to her?

242
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,447
Our enemy has the ability to steal souls.

243
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,158
We are looking for a soul he stole.

244
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:10,951
A soul?

245
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,621
The culprit's name is Pale Snake.

246
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,081
Please tell me anything you know.

247
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,168
Soul?

248
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,505
Could you be talking about this disc?

249
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,132
That disc!

250
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,344
This belongs to the janitor.

251
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,596
What's the significance of these discs?

252
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,265
Did he have two discs?

253
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,518
Two discs? He did.

254
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,729
A memory disc and a Stand disc.

255
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,814
Discs come in pairs.

256
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,358
Two discs make up a soul.

257
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,361
If only we can get his other disc,

258
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
we may be able to learn
the identity of Pale Snake!

259
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,990
Hell no…

260
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,367
No way!

261
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,787
It's still following me around.

262
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,123
Dammit! I thought I got far enough.

263
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,213
What's happening?

264
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,841
Electricity! That bastard!

265
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,344
He's electrocuting himself!

266
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,639
It... It stopped.

267
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,975
Electrical resistance.

268
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:21,981
You can't kill a person just by sending
100 volts of electricity on human skin.

269
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,108
We have electrical resistance.

270
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,235
That's why it stopped.

271
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,487
His suicide attempt failed.

272
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,488
But…

273
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,283
if he wants to electrocute himself again,

274
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,704
he'd be looking around
for some saline solution right about now.

275
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,500
Saline solution would increase
conductivity to almost 100 percent.

276
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,087
Electricity can pierce
and burn the heart completely.

277
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,672
Saline solution?

278
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,966
They are used as IVs and disinfectants.

279
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,301
There's a bunch by the infirmary!

280
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,887
I can't go any further.

281
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,934
There are too many inmates by the stairs!

282
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,480
I'll beat him up and take his other disc.

283
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,815
That's my only way!

284
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,869
Stop! Don't do this!

285
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,747
Look at my left arm!

286
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,334
It's a little burnt, just like your arm.

287
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,754
You have obtained a strange ability.

288
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:31,467
Every suicide attempt
is reflected onto me!

289
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,761
Don't think about suicide!

290
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,680
There are lots of fun
and lucky things in life too!

291
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,896
Four years ago,

292
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,732
I was only cleaning.

293
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,737
Cleaning the shotgun in my apartment.

294
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,824
But for some reason, the gun was loaded.

295
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,994
The gun accidentally fired.

296
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,789
I live on the tenth floor.

297
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,626
Just as the gun went off,
a woman jumped to kill herself.

298
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,295
It was like the lottery.

299
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,964
While some win millions of dollars,

300
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,967
I guess sometimes
the exact opposite happens.

301
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,013
She was supposed to
hit the ground and die.

302
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:24,144
Everyone thought that I aimed at
and killed the woman on the 11th floor.

303
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,606
The judge even called me cold-blooded.

304
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,192
That's the kind of man I am!

305
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,610
Hold on!

306
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,153
Oh, panties.

307
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,197
Has anyone given you panties before?

308
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,201
Wouldn't you feel lucky
if a girl gave you her panties?

309
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,454
You're going through
tough times right now.

310
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,914
But imagine.

311
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,874
If a girl gives you panties,

312
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,711
that means lucky things can happen
even at the worst moment.

313
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,047
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

314
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,674
But you can have it.

315
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,051
I'll give you the one I got on right now!

316
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,430
You'll really give me your panties?

317
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,268
I keep my promises.

318
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,519
But remember this.

319
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,064
Everyone hates Mondays.

320
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,235
We all hope for
the fun Saturdays to come around.

321
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,821
Not every day is a Monday!

322
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,448
I was arrested on a Saturday.

323
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:24,037
You're saying nice things to give me hope,

324
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,084
but I bet it's just lip service
to save yourself.

325
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,836
That's not…

326
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,463
You are pretending to be kind

327
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,341
just to get out of this situation.

328
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,011
You don't mean a word you say.

329
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,095
Am I wrong?

330
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,976
That's how everyone always treats me.

331
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,061
Nobody likes trash.

332
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,771
But I'm worse than trash.

333
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,401
My presence is invisible to everyone!

334
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,278
Hold on!

335
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,324
Yes, I'm talking to you
because I don't want to die.

336
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,701
But listen up.

337
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,537
You are being used by Pale Snake.

338
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,956
He's exploiting your mindset!

339
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,792
If you don't think about suicide,

340
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,170
nothing will happen!

341
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,716
You are the one who's being selfish,

342
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,052
you bastard!

343
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,100
You really are a nice person.

344
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,311
How wonderful.

345
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,480
Those words were sincere.

346
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,149
I sure am fortunate.

347
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,195
I ran into such
a beautiful woman before my passing.

348
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,074
Thank you!

349
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,951
If I can die with you…

350
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,453
If I can spend an eternity with you,

351
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,290
then I'm really blessed!

352
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,252
He's evil.

353
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,420
He is, without a doubt,

354
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,048
rotten to his core!

355
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,510
I'm not lonely!

356
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:07,307
-Here!
-Bastard! Let go of that switch!

357
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,902
That was close.

358
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,113
Too close, dammit!

359
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,490
I managed to attach the sticker.

360
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,451
It'll burn from the sparks of electricity.

361
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,578
Once the sticker burns off,

362
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,082
the copy created with the sticker will…

363
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,543
merge back to one!

364
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,096
Goddammit.

365
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,140
The shock made me remember.

366
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,228
He hid the money he stole, 5,000 dollars.

367
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,398
I'll take it as payment, you little shit.

368
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,443
