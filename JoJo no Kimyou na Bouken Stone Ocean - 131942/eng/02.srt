EPISODE 2: PRISONER FE40536: JOLYNE CUJOH

2
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,396
Welcome, inmates.

3
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,317
I am the warden of
Green Dolphin Street State Prison,

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,985
Locobaroco.

5
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,489
And this lovely crocodile here

6
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,533
is Charlotte, my assistant.

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,909
Great to meet you!

8
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,286
Charlotte,

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,458
please explain how life is
in this institution.

10
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,459
Okay!

11
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,545
Similar to the United States,

12
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,173
this prison is based on
the concept of freedom and equality.

13
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,927
You may freely walk around the facility

14
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,679
and exercise as you please.

15
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,099
You may use the phones,
the shower, and the library as well.

16
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,269
If you are an exemplary inmate,
you may even own a TV.

17
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,398
You could also work or study
and earn university credits.

18
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,525
That's right.

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,820
Yes! What is it, Charlotte?

20
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,365
But Warden, there are rules too, right?

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,450
You're absolutely correct, Charlotte!

22
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:45,165
First, do not remove the wristband
with your inmate number.

23
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,626
No lending or borrowing of items
between inmates.

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,920
No possession of metal objects.

25
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,839
How about earrings?

26
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,341
The warden's still speaking! Shut up!

27
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,514
Earrings are prohibited,
FE40536, Jolyne Cujoh.

28
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,310
Feel free to ask any questions
to the prison guards.

29
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,312
You are now dismissed.

30
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,773
All right! Everyone, face left!

31
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,651
It's so spacious.

32
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,029
The entire island is the prison.

33
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,739
Oh, a crocodile.

34
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,628
FE40536.

35
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,131
Cell 206 will be your home from now on.

36
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,804
Today's free time is over.

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,265
The cells open at 6:30 a.m.

38
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,686
Breakfast begins at seven,
but you may choose to sleep in.

39
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,773
Try to get along now.

40
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,486
Nice to meet you.

41
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,780
Nice to meet you too.

42
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,323
I'm Jolyne.

43
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,699
I'm Gwess.

44
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,825
Want some?

45
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,868
Thanks.

46
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,163
But I don't have an appetite.
There's so much to get used to--

47
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,126
Ouch! What the hell--

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,587
The bottom bunk is mine!

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,799
You got a problem with that, you bitch?

50
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,642
I didn't mean to instigate a fight.

51
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,271
I just misunderstood since
your things were on the top bunk.

52
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,275
That charm!

53
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,360
Bitch!

54
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,320
Get your dirty hands off of my stuff!

55
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,989
Can I see that charm?

56
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,952
There should be a small stone
and a photograph of my parents inside!

57
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,204
It could have belonged to me!

58
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,750
I bought it for two dollars
from a newcomer the other day.

59
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,627
Because it's just so beautiful.

60
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,254
Let me see it!

61
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,340
You better watch your mouth, ugly!

62
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,261
Okay, I'll buy it off of you.

63
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,054
How much do you want?

64
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,222
Two hundred dollars.

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,265
What?

66
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,310
You heard me, dumbass. I said 200 dollars.

67
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,227
You bitch…

68
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,778
Lights out!

69
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,915
What's going on?

70
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,626
Too much is happening all at once.

71
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,382
I have so much to think about.

72
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,138
I'm so sad that I'm starting to cry.

73
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,109
What the hell?

74
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,487
I'm sorry. About last night, I mean.

75
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,696
What?

76
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,032
It's morning.

77
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,618
Here.

78
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,789
You can look at it.

79
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,915
But…

80
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,501
There was nothing inside it.

81
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,878
No pictures, no nothing.

82
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,879
See?

83
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,218
Was there anything else in it?
Like a stone?

84
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,886
No. Nothing.

85
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,306
Anyway, please forgive
my behavior last night.

86
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,727
I'm shy around new people.

87
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,273
Oh, there's nothing to forgive.
It was my fault.

88
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,734
I don't know the rules around here yet.

89
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,862
Jolyne, you are a good person.

90
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,823
Let's be friends from now on.

91
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,950
Yes, I'd like that.

92
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,872
Anyway, it's breakfast time.

93
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,040
I'll see you there.

94
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,376
Hold on, I'll go with you.

95
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,587
What the hell?

96
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,214
There's water all over the place!

97
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,343
My pants are soaking wet. This sucks!

98
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,854
What do you mean it's "sold out"?

99
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,605
I haven't eaten yet.

100
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,940
As you can see,

101
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,025
you're free to sleep in.

102
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,944
You're also free to get here late.

103
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,029
Isn't there food for everyone?

104
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,073
Any leftover milk or bananas?

105
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,784
That's the strange thing about prisons.

106
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,035
That makes no sense!

107
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,788
Oh, Jolyne, you took your sweet time.

108
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,332
I'm so full.

109
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,962
Hey, Gwess.

110
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,965
You had two milk cartons and two bananas!

111
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,091
Two bananas?

112
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,469
No way. Are you still asleep?

113
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,055
Also, sorry about the water.
I accidentally spilled it.

114
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,932
I'll clean it up later.

115
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,559
I already cleaned it off.

116
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,269
Oh, thank you.

117
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,896
You're so kind, Jolyne.

118
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,068
This is…

119
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,370
Jump for me. I believe in you.

120
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,539
I love you,

121
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,875
and you love me.

122
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,836
Don't we trust one another?

123
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,839
Do it for me.

124
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,888
Good boy!

125
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:38,601
Aren't you an adorable little birdie?

126
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,354
Good job! Here's your reward!

127
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,105
Good morning!

128
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,859
No, Pi-chan.

129
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,319
Not "good morning."

130
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,071
Say "I love you."

131
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,783
You're such a darling
when you say that you love me.

132
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,201
I love you!

133
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,453
Good boy!

134
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,206
You're such a good boy, Pi-chan!

135
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,708
Next, perch.

136
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,377
Jump over.

137
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,839
Taking risks is part
of trust-building, Pi-chan.

138
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,924
What?

139
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,635
Come on, jump!

140
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,763
Whoa…

141
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,516
What did you just say? "Whoa"?

142
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,601
Say that again!

143
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,187
Do birds go "whoa"?

144
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,358
I love you! I love you! I love you!

145
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,527
You're covering it up now, aren't you?

146
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,905
You think such a blatant lie works on me?

147
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,699
Do you?

148
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,119
I've had it with you.

149
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,996
We're through.

150
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,459
What was that?

151
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,796
A banana?

152
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,221
What is this?

153
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,111
Though it's tiny,

154
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,863
it's definitely real.

155
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,575
That woman…

156
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,328
had already killed it!

157
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,265
What is she doing?

158
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,103
I knew it, she must have used that charm

159
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,231
to gain some sort of ability!

160
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,859
Where did she get that tiny human?

161
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,245
What…

162
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,915
happened to me?

163
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,880
STAND NAME: G.G. DOLLS
STAND MASTER: GWESS

164
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,299
This is…

165
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,802
My body shrank!

166
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,970
I knew it was you.

167
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,434
How did you snatch away my Pi-chan?

168
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:32,900
Jolyne!

169
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,362
Jolyne.

170
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,741
I'm starting to like you, really.

171
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,827
What happened to my body?

172
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,994
Explain!

173
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,164
Listen, Jolyne. Please don't talk.

174
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,916
The person inside that parrot--

175
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,919
Hey, I said no talking!

176
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,338
Get in it.

177
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,425
I removed its guts.

178
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,802
There was a flaw to using a parrot.

179
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,888
Birds can't use their arms
and they can't grab.

180
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,850
Rats, though, have front paws.

181
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,187
He was a prison guard
who got fired for slacking off.

182
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,648
The warden thinks he left the facility.

183
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,238
Also, I told you to keep quiet.

184
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,741
But if you can mimic
a rat squeak, I'll let it pass.

185
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,619
You can say, "I'm going, squeak!"
or "I'm hungry, squeak!"

186
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,455
Got it?

187
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,584
Just as I thought, you look darling!

188
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,919
Now it's time for training.

189
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,465
Go, faster. Run!

190
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,926
No slowing down.

191
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,390
Lift, Chorokichi.

192
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,975
Chorokichi?

193
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,685
Everything has a name.

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,063
The Word was with God,

195
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,025
and all things were created by the Word.

196
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:01,989
That's why I named this power
that shrank your size.

197
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,908
"G.G. Dolls."

198
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,952
This is the name of my mental power.

199
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,871
Let's stack another book.

200
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,542
You…

201
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,588
You think you can cheat me like that?

202
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,467
How dare you betray my trust.

203
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,972
We're through!

204
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,682
Just kidding!

205
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,434
You passed, Chorokichi.

206
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,187
Your shrewdness will prove useful.

207
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,189
Very very good!

208
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,070
Can you see?

209
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,074
Down this corridor is the control room.

210
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,952
The switch within that room

211
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,496
can deactivate the locks in this facility.

212
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,498
You can pass through.

213
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,334
You see what I'm getting at.

214
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,961
You are I are breaking out.

215
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,297
For some reason, I can't shrink myself.

216
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,258
But if we cooperate, we can leave.

217
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,009
We need to trust each other.

218
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,304
Of course, we'll need
to concoct a more reliable plan.

219
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,267
First, I want you to check out
everything beyond this corridor.

220
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,520
Do you really think we can escape?

221
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,774
I told you to squeak like a rat!

222
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,028
Squeak, how do I get

223
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,531
to the control room, squeak?

224
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,118
How cute! How precious.

225
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,829
But how should I know, dumbass?

226
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,707
That's why you're on this mission.

227
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,875
Look up.

228
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,376
That's the surveillance camera.

229
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,587
But it can't see below this bar.

230
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,505
Walk under the handrail.

231
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,966
Put your hood on.

232
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,101
Now go!

233
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,406
Hey, you. What are you doing?

234
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,242
That's right, you with the headband.

235
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,870
State your name and number!

236
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,539
FE18081.

237
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,209
My name is Gwess.
I'm just loitering around.

238
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,503
If you have no business here, then leave!

239
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,588
Leave immediately.

240
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,215
Sure thing, Mr. Prison Guard.

241
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:38,062
There are four steel doors.
Which one is the control room?

242
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,981
Also, there are two cameras here.

243
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,985
What's going on? I'm running out of space.

244
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,862
What's happening?

245
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,284
Did you hear that?

246
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,411
Yes, I heard it too.

247
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,829
It was close by.

248
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,083
My body…

249
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,001
It's getting larger!

250
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,962
The coffee's ready.

251
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,005
Maybe it was from the coffee maker.

252
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,675
-It didn't sound like it.
-This is bad. What's going on?

253
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,343
Distance?

254
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,346
Is it because Gwess is far from me?

255
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,807
Is this ability affected by distance?

256
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,018
I heard it again!

257
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,228
Something's lurking nearby!

258
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,980
Shit!

259
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,566
It's right under there!
Hey, move out of the way!

260
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,693
I said move it!

261
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,822
That's hot!

262
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,366
What the hell, man?

263
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,827
What the…

264
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,205
I told you it was from the coffee maker!

265
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,289
My bad.

266
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,668
This investigation is over!

267
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,838
I need to get back before I get too big!

268
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,887
What is that?

269
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,808
G.G. Dolls!

270
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,527
This monster…

271
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,339
This monster…
It resembles a doll, but it's transparent.

272
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,426
It's just like my thread.
Others can't see it.

273
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,344
It's the materialization
of Gwess's ability.

274
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,680
"G.G. Dolls."

275
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,141
This is the name of my mental power.

276
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,227
It shrank me

277
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,313
and tore the prison guard to shreds!

278
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,985
This shithead was inside the rat with me!

279
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,029
And Gwess.

280
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,865
She didn't know that
the ability would get deactivated.

281
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,242
My body is returning to its original size.

282
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,955
This monster thinks I'm ditching,
so he's here for a hunt!

283
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,042
Not only that,
he wants to completely kill me!

284
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,842
-G.G. Dolls!
-Shit!

285
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,887
Why is this happening to me?

286
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,848
Am I going to get killed
by a monster like him?

287
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,727
I'm stuck!

288
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,138
Threads.

289
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,472
A bundle of threads.

290
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,270
This must be the shape of my energy.

291
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,437
Its form!

292
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,400
The yarn weaves into its form.

293
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,860
Hey, monster!

294
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,990
Scream, you shithead!

295
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,366
Get Gwess.

296
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,492
Hurry!

297
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,577
Jolyne…

298
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,414
Turns out you have an ability.

299
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
Gwess!

300
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,709
Stop!

301
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,087
Don't hurt my precious G.G. Dolls!

302
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,255
Shut up!

303
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,049
Make my body smaller so I can escape!

304
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,926
Just by a bit, though, got it?

305
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,013
All right, you can sleep on
the bottom bunk bed!

306
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,891
Please don't hate me despite
what happened between us!

307
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,603
But please squeak every once in a while.

308
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,855
Just hurry it up!

309
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,275
Finally.

310
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,277
Now, the charm.

311
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,655
Give me the stone
and tell me who sold it to you.

312
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,866
Of course.

313
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,409
Two hundred dollars, was it--

314
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,411
Shut up, bitch!

315
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,913
Tell me who sold it to you!

316
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,456
All right.

317
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,584
Some woman named Ermes sold it to me.

318
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,793
Ermes?

319
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,795
I don't know much about her.

320
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,130
Here.

321
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,763
Well…

322
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,852
I got her!

323
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,647
Guards! We have a problem!

324
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,691
This bitch here crossed the gun point!

325
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,735
Come here, quick!

326
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,239
What are you doing there?

327
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,242
How did you get over there?

328
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,162
Jailbreak!

329
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,164
Code 999!

330
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,045
It's all over for you now.

331
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,173
The prison guard
is retrieving the shotgun as we speak.

332
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,009
He has every right to shoot you down!

333
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,761
No questions asked!

334
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,972
Jolyne!

335
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,682
Serves you right!

336
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,768
It's what you get
for trampling on my heart!

337
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,481
Good grief, Gwess.

338
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,859
You said everything has a name.

339
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,112
I'll name this ability of mine too.

340
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,197
"Stone Ocean."

341
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,325
I'll become free
from this ocean of stones.

342
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,035
Did you hear me?

343
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,539
Stone Ocean. That's the name.

344
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,677
If there's a hierarchy system
in this prison, I'll follow it.

345
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,971
However, I'm the one who gives orders.

346
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,516
Now let me cross over.

347
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,770
-What?
-Where is she?

348
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,149
-She disappeared.
-What?

349
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,942
Are you sure she was there?

350
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,528
Well, I just saw her back, so…

351
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,238
Strange…

352
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,750
Dad…

353
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:46,216
