1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,973
I have obtained a disc.

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,057
Just one of them.

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,892
We can bring him back.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,937
I just know that
the discs will bring him back.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,649
Let's call it
Operation Savage Guardian for now.

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,818
You should take him.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,403
He can aid your cause.

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,323
His name is Weather Forecast.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,492
Jumpin' Jack Spark!

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,411
Weather Forecast!

11
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,628
But where did he go?

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,048
I need to get the disc back!

13
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,016
EPISODE 11: OPERATION SAVAGE GUARDIAN
(HEAD TO THE COURTYARD!) (2)

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,977
Emergency alarm activated.

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,395
Corridor 7B.

16
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,606
-Yes, that's correct. Corridor 7B.
-Emergency alarm activated.

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,483
We are awaiting reports.

18
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,985
Did something happen?

19
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,361
We aren't sure as of yet.

20
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,824
But Corridor 7B's sole function
is for access to the factory.

21
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,286
There is no possibility
that it is a fire or a prisoner riot.

22
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,537
Rest assured.

23
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,497
Yes, indeed.

24
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,751
I trust this prison and the prisoners.

25
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,590
With all the commotion,
curiosity got the better of me.

26
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,259
Surely, you are aware

27
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,804
that no prisoner has managed
to escape from this prison for 20 years.

28
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,932
Furthermore, the courtyard
is outside of Corridor 7B.

29
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,019
No prisoner would choose
to escape from there, of all places.

30
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,855
You're quite right.

31
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,481
Leave the rest to us, Father.

32
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,900
I'll be off then.

33
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,326
Just one more thing out of curiosity…

34
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,621
Is the clock on the wall accurate?

35
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,998
Yes, of course.

36
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,751
It is now 11:58 a.m.

37
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,419
It's almost lunchtime.

38
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,967
11:51 a.m.

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,428
A call to The Speedwagon Foundation.

40
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,474
I have the usual request.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,646
I'd like access to the collect call list
and the recorded conversations.

42
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,815
Women's prison, phone booth 16.

43
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,860
The call from about seven minutes ago.

44
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,404
Weather Forecast.

45
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,740
Since you touched me,

46
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,368
you are now weightless too.

47
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,500
I don't see our enemy anywhere.

48
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,585
We need to retrieve the disc right away.

49
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,796
Stay calm.

50
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,299
He must be within this laundry room.

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,592
He is lurking somewhere.

52
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,388
The courtyard is past that door.

53
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,182
You are trying to reach that door,

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,352
but it is most likely locked.

55
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,772
You might need to blast it,
or force it open somehow.

56
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,068
There's... A slight problem...

57
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,447
I know now's not the time for this…

58
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,574
It's a personal thing…

59
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,619
But it's urgent, and I need to go now.

60
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,830
So, like…

61
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,417
I don't know why it suddenly so suddenly.

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,294
But, well…

63
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,546
It's something that happens to everyone!

64
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,549
What is this about?

65
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,758
Well,

66
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,095
it's the P-word related to
the pelvic area.

67
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,973
I'm just glad it's not "number two."

68
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,891
You know, the biological phenomenon!

69
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,311
You need to take a piss?

70
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,271
No need to say it up close.

71
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,898
I'm serious. I need to go.

72
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,111
Just pick any corner.

73
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:25,074
Dammit, why did I even try
talking to a guy about this?

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,035
I have relieved myself already.

75
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,203
See? It's floating over there.

76
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,793
In zero gravity, the blood in your body
will suddenly collect in your head.

77
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,298
Blood that is usually in the lower parts
of the body due to gravity.

78
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:45,053
The space between the skin and the bone
is swollen and squishy with blood.

79
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,888
It's called a "moon face."

80
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,099
However,

81
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,353
it's dangerous when too much blood
goes to your head.

82
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,732
The kidney automatically works harder
to reduce the amount of blood.

83
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,735
This triggers an acute diuretic effect.

84
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,237
It attempts to thin the blood content

85
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,073
by expelling salt.

86
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,200
-But--
-Don't worry.

87
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,285
I'll use my clouds to absorb your urine.

88
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,244
What?

89
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,418
Hey, wait, what are these droplets?

90
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,587
They're leaking out of your cloud!

91
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,350
Weather Forecast!

92
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,935
No, that's not it.

93
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,437
It's being sucked out
through the gap in the wall!

94
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,730
Me too.

95
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
Blood from the wound I got earlier.

96
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,443
My nose won't stop bleeding!

97
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,406
I'm having difficulty breathing…

98
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,241
No, it can't be!

99
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,828
Jolyne!

100
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,006
Everything I touch becomes zero gravity.

101
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,178
I touched the walls leading to the door.

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,641
That means the whole room
is unaffected by gravity!

103
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,813
The air!
Air can't stay in zero gravity!

104
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,691
It'll get pulled by
the surrounding gravity, and it'll escape!

105
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,278
We need to close up the gap!

106
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,781
Otherwise, we'll suffocate to death!

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,032
Jolyne, you're wrong.

108
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,034
Suffocation isn't our primary concern.

109
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,789
The blood in our bodies will boil first,
leading to our death.

110
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,586
In a vacuum, blood boils up like water.

111
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
In a zero-gravity vacuum,

112
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,215
people's blood will dry up in 20 seconds,

113
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,177
before even suffocating.

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,608
I'll reload my bullets.

115
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,361
We'll get shot.

116
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,239
We must hide somewhere!

117
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,657
What are you saying?

118
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,326
I'm bleeding out of my nose!

119
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,119
We need to stop the air!

120
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,787
Weather Forecast!

121
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,736
Just take shallow breaths.

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,031
I gathered what little air
is remaining in this room,

123
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,243
and covered our bodies with clouds.

124
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,372
Cloud suits.

125
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,708
The room is almost a complete vacuum.

126
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,586
This is all the remaining air.

127
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,214
Your nosebleed has stopped.

128
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,552
How long can we keep breathing?

129
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,221
I wish I didn't have to answer that.

130
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,682
I'd say about two minutes.

131
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,767
It's a cloud suit on the verge of death.

132
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,687
If we don't defeat our enemy
within that time,

133
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,107
we'll be thrown into the vacuum, right?

134
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,317
Precisely.

135
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,737
Where is he?

136
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,948
We must find him.

137
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,825
Whether we act or not,

138
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,661
his attack will finish us both.

139
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,831
Hey, now that my nosebleed has stopped,

140
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,541
I notice something.

141
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,834
Listen, Jolyne.

142
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,378
I said two minutes, but it could be one!

143
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,338
We must find him immediately!

144
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,340
Carbon dioxide is increasing as we speak!

145
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,009
The laundry hampers.

146
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,136
They aren't floating.

147
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,847
The hampers over there.

148
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,184
I touched the walls, shutters,
and floor of this room.

149
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,895
That's why the whole room
entered zero gravity,

150
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,564
and everything is floating.

151
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,402
But why are those hampers
and barrels not floating,

152
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,987
and attached to the floor?

153
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,073
Also, that enemy.

154
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,745
How is he breathing in a vacuum?

155
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,831
Shouldn't his blood be boiling over?

156
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,502
In other words,

157
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,922
that's the range of his ability.

158
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,384
There is a distance range
to this zero gravity.

159
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,220
It's not the entire room!

160
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,764
An attack range!

161
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,932
From here to the hampers

162
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,310
is about 20 meters or so.

163
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,354
Zero gravity ends there.

164
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,607
If we can get there,
there will surely be normal air!

165
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,443
You must go, Weather Forecast.

166
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,236
He is outside of the vacuum range.

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,906
If you do not control the air now,

168
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,158
we will never reach our enemy.

169
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,911
You may be correct.

170
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,621
Outside that hamper…

171
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,046
Go, Weather Forecast.

172
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,007
The pressure in the suit
is becoming strange.

173
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,594
Go before this cloud suit
disperses into the vacuum!

174
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,407
Don't think you can
get out of my attack range!

175
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,700
He's gonna shoot him down!

176
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,535
I won't let you!

177
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,455
I'll protect Weather Forecast!

178
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,962
STAND NAME: WEATHER FORECAST
STAND MASTER: WEATHER FORECAST

179
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,298
He's coming around us!

180
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,800
I'll charge ahead!

181
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,463
He's going to reach air in a few meters.

182
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,215
Once Weather Forecast gets air,

183
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,967
he's going to corner you!

184
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,095
If you want air that bad, you can have it.

185
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,015
No need to even reach the hampers.

186
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,058
I just now

187
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,020
completed my attack.

188
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,485
I wasn't trying to ricochet
the bullets to injure him.

189
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,196
I shot the barrel itself!

190
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,118
A bit of air is left in the barrel.

191
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,954
Highly pressurized air

192
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,582
on the verge of explosion, that is!

193
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,544
Weather Forecast!

194
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,764
He was pushed back to zero gravity.

195
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,891
He is done for.

196
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,480
He won't be able to gain enough force
to stop the momentum.

197
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,900
Weather Forecast!

198
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,859
This is it.

199
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,862
The suit itself is about to collapse!

200
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,040
Jolyne! How reckless!

201
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,416
You must go back!

202
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,709
He'll shoot you down!

203
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,088
That thrust itself
will dissipate your suit!

204
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,841
She makes incredibly quick decisions.

205
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,803
She charged into that bastard
to stop his movement,

206
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,349
and to push him outside of
the zero gravity again!

207
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,269
However,

208
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,146
I won't let you through!

209
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,484
I already know.

210
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,736
Your Stand is very powerful.

211
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:28,576
My rotating bullets aren't fast enough,
and would get flicked away in defense.

212
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,953
That's why I've been preparing.

213
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,580
I've looked for them.

214
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,708
I'd captured them away from view.

215
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,670
There were quite a lot.

216
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,630
Rats! They're alive!

217
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,550
Could they be…

218
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,010
Stone Ocean!

219
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,928
Push them away!

220
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,892
I can't see!

221
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,226
Okay!

222
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,606
I did not expect you to fight
against my ability like this.

223
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,608
This is checkmate.

224
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,986
You're finished, Jolyne Cujoh!

225
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,908
My mission is now complete!

226
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,667
Jumpin' Jack Spark is the best.

227
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,462
I feel invincible.

228
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,589
I'm glad I was imprisoned here.

229
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,342
With this ability I obtained here,

230
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,011
there is nothing I can't do in this world.

231
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,680
My future is rosy!

232
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,892
I will hand this disc over to Pale Snake.

233
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,020
I can defeat him too, if I wanted to.

234
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,564
WIth my own hands!

235
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,163
I knew it…

236
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,211
I knew you'd do it.

237
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,879
I was waiting

238
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,547
for you to reload.

239
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,925
I was waiting with my threads ready

240
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,052
for you to reload your gun.

241
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,554
And you shot at me.

242
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,306
These threads!

243
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,308
When the hell did you do this?!

244
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,977
Stone Ocean!

245
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,567
What?

246
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,370
You are the one in a complete vacuum.

247
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,746
And now,

248
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,916
without a suit, your blood will boil up

249
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,793
and explode faster than us!

250
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,714
We won!

251
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,215
If you don't want to die,

252
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,635
you must deactivate
the zero gravity immediately!

253
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,597
Dammit!

254
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,686
The crime that put me in this prison…

255
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,231
How many times did I stab her?

256
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,735
When I killed the female professor,

257
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,946
the prosecutor said
I stabbed her 69 times.

258
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,407
That compulsion.

259
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,325
It's surging within me once more.

260
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,036
Shit.

261
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,079
I won't let you underestimate me.

262
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,539
That bitch!

263
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,377
A reaction between hydrogen peroxide
and manganese dioxide

264
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,963
produces oxygen.

265
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,676
Just like the oxygen in this bottle,
it keeps coming out!

266
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:38,724
My urge to slaughter someone
like back then!

267
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,683
Take this!

268
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:45,064
I'll make a headstone out of
your piss-soaked body with this glass!

269
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,328
Jolyne Cujoh,
your blood vessels will rupture first

270
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,914
since you are covered in wounds!

271
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,249
I got incarcerated for murder.

272
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:09,046
I will kill you
and leave this place an invincible man!

273
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,223
Take this.

274
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,474
This will be sufficient

275
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,227
just to take the disc back

276
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,564
from that bastard.

277
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,026
Weather Forecast!

278
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,529
What?

279
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,990
Dammit! My body is at its limit!

280
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,452
If I deactivate my ability,
the air will rush in.

281
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,539
I may be able to escape using the impact!

282
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,667
Zero gravity, deactivate!

283
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,878
Jumpin' Jack Spark!

284
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,851
You should've deactivated it
the first chance you had.

285
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,104
The change in air pressure
might have let you escape.

286
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,817
If only you had deactivated it while
you still had distance from Stone Ocean.

287
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,281
The air is blowing you back toward me!

288
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,808
How much longer
until The Speedwagon Foundation arrives?

289
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,977
Three minutes? Or two minutes?

290
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,981
There is a corridor past this door.

291
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,694
Alongside the right wall, there are
windows that look out to the courtyard.

292
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,239
There, you'll be able to see
a revolving door's gate.

293
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,325
This gate leads to the courtyard.

294
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,830
The gate is accessible
during the day and is unlocked.

295
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,585
The next challenge
is how to go about opening this door.

296
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,545
I'll get a prison guard to open it.

297
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,381
We have his work permit.

298
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,426
We'll trick them into opening it.

299
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,012
I see.

300
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,806
Once the door opens,
you'll knock the guards out

301
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,559
and force your way to the courtyard.

302
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,269
Very well.

303
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,023
Not only will you be charged
with attempted escape,

304
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,026
but you'll also receive
solitary confinement for six months

305
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,279
where you cannot even
exercise sufficiently.

306
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,281
That's fine.

307
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,784
I'll go to the courtyard

308
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,495
and hand this disc over to someone
from The Speedwagon Foundation.

309
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,583
That's my only mission in life right now.

310
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,093
The guards are coming.

311
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,513
Weather Forecast,
go find somewhere to hide.

312
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,015
I'll go by myself from here.

313
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,934
You're severely wounded,

314
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,436
and if the guards see your injury,

315
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,021
they might lock the gate.

316
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,815
Very well. I understand.

317
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,571
What is it?

318
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,615
Why are you knocking?

319
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,121
It's you.

320
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,248
"It's you"?

321
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,418
What is it, Rangler?

322
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,169
What is this noise about?

323
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,213
Hold still. I'll open the door.

324
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,513
If you are returning to the men's prison,

325
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,726
Lang Rangler, how about we stop
by the chapel on the way?

326
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,270
I'd like to speak to you.

327
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,732
It's not a guard!

328
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,367
Who is he?

329
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,370
He's neither a guard nor a prisoner!

330
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,750
What could his attire mean?

331
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:46,007
