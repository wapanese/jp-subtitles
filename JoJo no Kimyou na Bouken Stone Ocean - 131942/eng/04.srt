1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,559
Tomorrow at noon,

2
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,562
you will have a visitor.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,522
But you must not meet him.

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,817
You must not go to the visitation room.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,527
Someone's here to see you.

6
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,657
Turn around. Go back to your room!

7
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,744
Dad…

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,538
Johngalli A.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,332
This man was behind it all.

10
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,753
Johngalli A. is,
without a doubt, a Stand user.

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,964
Just know that you are being targeted.

12
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,924
I'll get you out immediately.

13
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,342
My handcuffs!

14
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,802
When did I get free?

15
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,388
Jolyne, get away from that door!

16
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,142
Star Platinum: The World!

17
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,603
Time, stop!

18
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,445
What happened just now?

19
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,906
Stay still! The fight has already begun.

20
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,575
Aerodynamics.

21
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,120
It detected our positions
using aerodynamics.

22
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,582
Do not make a move
until we understand the contraption.

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,418
Don't order me around.

24
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:30,590
-I know that!
-You… FE40536!

25
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,885
Who do you think you're talking to?
You bastard!

26
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,220
Jolyne!

27
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,937
-You…
-Don't move!

28
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,028
Keep your voice down.

29
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,115
It'll detect our position again.

30
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,577
Johngalli A. uses
that Stand to read the airflow.

31
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,288
It may even react
to the change in our breathing.

32
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,250
Plus, that Stand can be used remotely.

33
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,129
He can shoot at that Stand
to reflect the bullet to his target.

34
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,255
It's a sniping Stand.

35
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,676
We cannot attack Johngalli A.,
who is in the men's prison.

36
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,221
We have to destroy that long-range Stand.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:22,350
Any damage dealt
to the Stand is reflected on its user.

38
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,685
I'm well aware.

39
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:27,397
The problem is,
the moment we move to prompt an attack,

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,026
the Stand will detect our position
and Johngalli A. will shoot at us.

41
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,962
Stay by the wall, Jolyne!

42
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,590
It's detecting your location!

43
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,842
Jolyne,

44
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,886
what are you thinking?

45
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,858
EPISODE 4: THE VISITOR (2)

46
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,132
Your own muscles cannot be trusted.

47
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,719
When skin comes in contact with a breeze,

48
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,764
the muscles have a twitching reflex.

49
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,476
This is an automatic reflex
you cannot control.

50
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,522
Therefore, I use my bones
to affix the rifle.

51
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,650
Bones land firmly on the surface.

52
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,028
The gun is as stable
as the surface itself.

53
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,113
Its stability is something we can trust.

54
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,409
Meteorologists may argue
that the direction of drafts

55
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,869
cannot be predicted.

56
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,371
That may be true, but only to an extent.

57
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,210
Is this fly flying randomly?

58
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,129
No.

59
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,842
It flies while smelling things nearby
and feeling the air current.

60
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,720
The wind is the fly's movement.

61
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,982
Just as the guard said,

62
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,984
Jotaro Kujo is here.

63
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,321
He's here to see
his daughter, Jolyne Cujoh.

64
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,658
The descendant of the Joestars
is in the visitation room

65
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,577
at this very moment.

66
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,289
Within range of my ability,
Downtown Transfer.

67
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,959
Joestar…

68
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,920
Joestar!

69
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,923
My life will finally begin

70
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,550
after I eradicate your family's blood!

71
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:30,014
You will pay for robbing me
of the one who was my rock!

72
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,949
I see.

73
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,369
You said we have to destroy it, right?

74
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,538
Look at its movement.

75
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,082
It can't detect the wind
due to the precipitation.

76
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,293
Now's my chance! Stone Ocean!

77
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,421
No, wait! Look closer!

78
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,760
It's evading every drop of water.

79
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,763
It's reading the drops' air current
to avoid them.

80
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,684
Jolyne, go back to the wall!
He's going to shoot at us!

81
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,608
This isn't good.
Once the guards arrive, the air will stir!

82
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,824
-Hey, listen!
-What?

83
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,412
Hurry, move the base of the pillar!

84
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,247
Kick it with all your might!

85
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,293
-But you're…
-Don't worry about me.

86
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,004
Got that? Please don't forget what I said.

87
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,922
I want you to survive!

88
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,722
I don't know why,

89
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,224
but there's a descending hole
between the walls.

90
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,226
It seems to be a passage.

91
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,272
Maybe it leads to
the sewer or the vent.

92
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,107
What is this?

93
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,610
It may lead us to the outside.

94
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,945
Let's go, Jolyne.
Seems it's our only option.

95
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,078
-It flew away…
-No.

96
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,455
It's still close.

97
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,708
It's looking for
the perfect angle to snipe us.

98
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,792
No…

99
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,215
It's following the boy
on the other side of this door.

100
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,761
He plans to hunt the boy
because he helped us escape.

101
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,971
Jolyne, go down the hole!

102
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,265
I came to break you out!

103
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,069
Before I entered this room…

104
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,782
he grabbed this arm of mine.

105
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm sure of it.

106
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,495
I can't believe it, but he's here.

107
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,207
He was just an ordinary kid
like you'd see at any park.

108
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,335
And we don't know each other…
We're complete strangers.

109
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,128
But…

110
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,798
he grabbed my arm
with desperation in his eyes.

111
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,428
The warmth of his hand
even felt as if he cared about me.

112
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,932
I'm going back inside.

113
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,850
Before he shoots the boy,

114
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,520
I'll kill Johngalli A.!

115
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,192
Good grief.

116
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,533
To the visitation room!

117
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,493
That's where the fire alarm went off!

118
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,453
There are no cameras there.

119
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,998
-Be prepared to engage!
-Where did he go?

120
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,294
That boy…

121
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,421
How does he move through this place,

122
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,090
appearing and disappearing
out of nowhere?

123
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,055
Hurry! To Visitation Room B!

124
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,272
Did that boy dig this hole?

125
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,191
This wall… So he used this!

126
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,658
His height is about 140cm.

127
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,453
His build is small, almost like a child's.

128
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,164
I don't know who he is,

129
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,042
but the hole
that suddenly opened is a vent.

130
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,919
I know where it leads by reading the air.

131
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,837
However…

132
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,092
I can't have this small guy
guide Jotaro and his daughter

133
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,929
deep underground
where I cannot reach them!

134
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,641
I will not lose those two again!

135
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,435
I'll finish this small one first!

136
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,647
Jolyne,

137
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,483
our situation is too dire.

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,903
Our Stands are only good
for defense at the moment.

139
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,907
Should we strike, Johngalli A. will read
the movement of the air.

140
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,242
This is too dangerous.

141
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,119
Hey, you!

142
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,704
You can't just leave the room!

143
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,872
This side is the prison!

144
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,874
-Good grief.
-Leave from the other side!

145
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,292
What the…

146
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,227
There it is!

147
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,317
Just as I thought, it's chasing the boy!

148
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,028
But there aren't any windows here.

149
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,781
How can he aim through the men's prison?

150
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,992
No… However…

151
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,287
This boy… Look at him!

152
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,623
How smart!

153
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,917
No, we're blessed!

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,254
With his body submerged completely
underwater, the air is unaffected!

155
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,005
And, he's inside a pipe!

156
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,717
Johngalli A. cannot find him now!

157
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,219
Not only that,
there are no windows down here.

158
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,179
Surely he can't shoot him now…

159
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,018
The pipe is bursting! But how?
Where is he aiming from?

160
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,482
Could he be…

161
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,663
Distance to the target is 321m.

162
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,041
The bullet drops 9.5cm while airborne,

163
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,378
and there's a slight ocean breeze of
3.2 meters per second.

164
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,047
The bullet will drift
by 4.2cm to the left.

165
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,133
Finding its target.

166
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,344
Targeting his heart.

167
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,304
Shit!

168
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,264
Stone Ocean!

169
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,684
Threads!

170
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,605
Jolyne Cujoh… This is her Stand ability!

171
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,607
She followed the boy down?

172
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,649
Is she an imbecile!

173
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,360
She thinks her net can stop my bullet?

174
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,863
Changing my target to Jolyne Cujoh.

175
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,573
Targeting the forehead.

176
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,534
Now, shoot!

177
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,384
How?

178
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,223
I'm so glad I broke this pipe beforehand.

179
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,437
The moment I came in,
I punctured this gas line.

180
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,940
Gas is lighter than air.

181
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:40,653
It creates a layer of gas
separate from oxygen.

182
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,239
I thought it would obscure your aim.

183
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,825
Man, was I right.

184
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,035
How did she do this?

185
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,621
You're too late! You're mine now!

186
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,082
Stone Ocean!

187
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,882
Seems you couldn't read your own fate.

188
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,848
STAND NAME: DOWNTOWN TRANSFER
STAND MASTER: JOHNGALLI A.

189
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,894
Who are you?

190
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,983
How is a child like you
roaming freely about this prison?

191
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,406
I hit myself.

192
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,492
This bone.

193
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,328
That's right. You gave me this.

194
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
What is it?

195
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,417
It looks like a bone. What's going on?

196
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,794
You tried to stop me
from going to the visitation room.

197
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,337
Just what do you know?

198
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,632
Hey, answer me!

199
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,760
Not yet… I can't, yet.

200
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,972
You mustn't let that go.

201
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,226
This smell.

202
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,770
Is this your doing?

203
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,690
That sniper guy, Johngalli A., his Stand?

204
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,734
It was nothing once I got to it.

205
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,904
I pounded it into a thousand pieces.

206
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,530
I see.

207
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,576
It seems you're quite used to
fighting with your Stand.

208
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,077
Not out of choice…

209
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,464
There he is! Right there!

210
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,465
He's on the move!

211
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,678
Hide! He has a rifle.

212
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,347
He's hiding behind that pipe.

213
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,015
I saw him going above the tank!

214
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,059
That's impossible.

215
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,438
He was targeting from the men's prison,
which is 200 to 300m away.

216
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,982
There are layers of bars between us.

217
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,276
Not only that,
he is almost completely blind.

218
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,154
How do you suppose he traveled so fast?

219
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,324
How the hell should I know?
If I said he's here, he's here!

220
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,241
Hide!

221
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,412
He's directly above you!

222
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,166
All right, I believe you.

223
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,170
And get ready.

224
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,590
The gas must have been accumulating.

225
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,892
We did it!

226
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,269
Hey, we're safe now!

227
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,480
What the…

228
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,565
Where did he run off to?

229
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,111
Are you hiding?

230
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,113
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

231
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,073
Come out and explain what's going on!

232
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,908
What are you doing?

233
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,660
I'm looking for the boy.

234
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,704
Did you see where he went?

235
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,456
I don't understand what you mean.

236
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,042
What boy are you talking about?

237
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,046
Oh, I see.

238
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,132
You didn't see him, did you?

239
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,511
I was talking to a little boy
outside the visitation room.

240
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,597
Johngalli A. tried to
get rid of him first.

241
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,557
Get rid of him?

242
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,227
What are you talking about?

243
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,355
You came here on your own.

244
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,316
And so I followed you.

245
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,194
Hold on, our stories aren't matching up.

246
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,697
You must have heard his voice.

247
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,199
No, I know you did!

248
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,286
He's the one who told us
about the secret passage!

249
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,871
You were there with me!

250
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,206
Did you hear a ghost or something?

251
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,542
I don't know of a secret passage.

252
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,337
Damn you! You're messing with me
at a time like this?

253
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,549
You're here now because
you followed me down the secret tunnel…

254
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,553
Hold on…

255
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,474
Something's not right with you.

256
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,017
Your wound…

257
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,520
You were shot.
What happened to your wound?

258
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,438
Wound?

259
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,774
The bullet wound
from when Johngalli A. shot you!

260
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,108
On your right shoulder.

261
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,403
But you aren't bleeding, and your clothes…

262
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,657
I don't have a scratch
from being shot either!

263
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,993
This man…

264
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,040
He isn't Johngalli A.!
He's the prison guard!

265
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,835
But I saw him get shot through the head!

266
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,253
His head is unscathed!

267
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,423
What do you mean he was shot?

268
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,509
And who is Johngalli A.?

269
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,553
What's going on?

270
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,388
Something's amiss.

271
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,057
It's not adding up!

272
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,023
What is this?

273
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,909
A fate more terrible than death
will await us all.

274
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,913
You must not go to the visitation room.

275
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,206
The visitation room…

276
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,709
That's right. Something was off
from the very beginning.

277
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,380
When was I uncuffed?

278
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,799
And that bullet…

279
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,592
Was I really shot back there?

280
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,222
But my dad and I don't have a scratch.

281
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:05,144
Was Johngalli A.
attacking us to begin with?

282
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,396
Something's wrong.

283
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,898
Nothing is making sense!

284
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,903
This isn't reality!

285
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,114
I'm in a dream of some sort.

286
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,075
No, I'm under someone's spell!

287
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,328
This is…

288
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,052
A dream…

289
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,432
Was I… dreaming?

290
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,560
Since when…

291
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,066
It looks like I did

292
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,444
knock out this prison guard.

293
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,156
This photo of Johngalli A…

294
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,827
Dad showed it to me.

295
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,956
The accident with the hitchhiker.

296
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,877
I heard that it was all
a plot to imprison me.

297
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,171
That was all real.

298
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,717
And then I tried to leave the room.

299
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,887
That's when I noticed I was uncuffed.

300
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,389
That was the moment.

301
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,436
No, I was sitting down when I awoke.

302
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,104
So before then…

303
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,859
We haven't stepped outside
of this visitation room.

304
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,903
In other words…

305
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,490
Johngalli A.'s Stand

306
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,452
was an illusion my mind created.

307
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,376
The secret passageway too.

308
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,797
The moment we stepped into
this visitation room,

309
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,677
we fell under their trap
and were forced to dream.

310
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,513
As if engulfed by a python,

311
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,516
slowly but surely,

312
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,768
we're being melted to the bone!

313
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,438
The boy in the garbage can
who gave me this bone.

314
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,482
He was real!

315
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,236
I was able to wake up

316
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,155
because I cut myself on this bone!

317
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,866
Without the pain from the cut,

318
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,952
I would have stayed asleep.

319
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:33,083
This ability is Johngalli A.'s attack!

320
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,216
My thread! I can't unravel it,
not even for a few centimeters!

321
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,469
This is bad!

322
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,140
Dammit.

323
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,810
I'm getting sleepy again…

324
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,814
We need to get out of here.

325
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,236
Out of this visitation room!

326
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,834
Stone Ocean!

327
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,258
