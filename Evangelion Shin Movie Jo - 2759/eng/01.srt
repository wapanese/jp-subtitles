00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,220
It shows up <i>now</i> , of all times!?

2
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,550
Geez...

3
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,060
<i>Due to the present state of emergency,</i>

4
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,440
<i>all phone lines have been disabled.</i>

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,150
No good, huh?

6
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,520
My cell phone has no signal,

7
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,610
and the buses and trains are shut down too.

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,860
on this!
Feast your eyes
'kay?
until I get there
Wait for me
Shinji

9
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,530
I guess it'll be impossible to meet her now.
on this!
Feast your eyes
'kay?
until I get there
Wait for me
Shinji

10
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,160
I've got no choice. I should head to a shelter.

11
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,700
All missiles have hit the target!

12
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,130
Sorry I made you wait!

13
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,990
<i>The target is still unharmed. It's continuing to advance towards Tokyo-3.</i>

14
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,240
<i>The Air Force is unable to stop it!</i>

15
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,250
Throw everything at it! Have even the 4th Division open fire!

16
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,580
Spare no expense! Destroy the target at all costs!

17
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,980
How the hell?! We made direct hits!!

18
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,730
The tank battalion was completely destroyed.

19
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,610
Missiles and artillery are useless...

20
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,070
It's pointless! This type of firepower's not going to get us anywhere!

21
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,240
So, it has an AT Field after all?

22
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,830
Yes...

23
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,660
Conventional weapons are useless against an Angel.

24
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,210
Understood. We'll deploy it according to plan.

25
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,180
No way... it can't be...!

26
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,890
They're going to use an N2 Mine?!

27
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,510
Get down!

28
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,200
We did it!

29
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,990
It seems you won't be needed this time.

30
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,040
Shockwave incoming!
It seems you won't be needed this time.

31
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,660
Shockwave incoming!

32
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,830
Are you okay?

33
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,210
Yeah... but I think I got some sand in my mouth.

34
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,250
Great! Here, help me out...

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,590
Get ready...

36
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,210
And PUSH!

37
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,270
Thanks! Couldn't have done it myself.

38
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,190
No, I should be thanking you, Katsuragi.

39
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,940
Call me Misato, all right?

40
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,770
It's nice to meet you, Shinji Ikari.

41
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,820
Yeah.

42
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,360
What is the target's status?

43
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,740
Due to radio interference, the target cannot be confirmed.
What is the target's status?

44
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,200
With that explosion, it must be obliterated.
Due to radio interference, the target cannot be confirmed.

45
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,410
<i>Restoring visual.</i>

46
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,590
And that was our trump card...

47
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,590
How is this possible...

48
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,180
Goddamn monster!

49
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,760
Thank God my Renault still works!

50
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,690
It'd be no joke for this car to die on me, since I've still got 12 payments left on the lease...

51
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,310
Anyway, I called ahead to reserve an express train for us,

52
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,820
so we might still make it in time!

53
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,860
Say, don't you have any questions for me, Shinji?

54
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,440
N-no.

55
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,240
I've been the only one talking here, you know!

56
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,030
Sorry...

57
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,450
Oh, it's nothing to apologize over,

58
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,620
but I was sure you were going to ask "What was that giant thing?,"

59
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,750
or maybe, "What's going on here?"

60
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,290
you know, those sorts of things?

61
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,670
Um, well...

62
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't see the point, since I didn't think you'd give me an answer anyway.

63
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,930
Wow, you sure jump to wrong conclusions, don't you?

64
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,340
That's something adults do, not teenagers!

65
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,680
It's okay.

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,770
I'm just following my directions.

67
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,560
Oh? Never mind then.

68
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,650
Just for your information, that thing was a mysterious life form we call an "Angel."

69
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,200
The 4th Angel...

70
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,540
It possesses an astounding regenerative capacity.

71
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,910
Complete by itself, it is a nearly-perfect living creature.

72
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,660
Of course it can regenerate.

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,790
Because Angels partook of the Fruit of Life, you mean?

74
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,630
Yes. They exist to exterminate us... we, who partook of the Fruit of Wisdom.

75
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,130
The gate is closing. Please be careful.

76
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,470
"Secret Military Agency NERV"...?

77
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,430
Yes, it's a private organization under the direct control of the U.N..

78
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,810
That's where my father is?

79
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,940
Well, yeah...

80
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,520
Do you know what your dad's job is?

81
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,440
"Work of utmost importance in the protection of humanity."

82
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,990
That's what my teacher said.

83
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,370
From here on, you will be in command of this operation.

84
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,580
Show us what you can do.

85
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,790
Understood.

86
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:24,960
Ikari, I have to admit that nothing in our arsenal is effective against the target.

87
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,250
So you claim you can defeat this thing?

88
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,090
NERV exists for that very purpose.

89
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,390
Are we going to where my father is?

90
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,890
Yeah, I imagine he'll be there.

91
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,020
<i>Father...</i>

92
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,480
By the way, did your father send you an ID card?

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,900
Ah, yeah.

94
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Here you go.

95
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,360
Thanks.

96
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,200
Here, read this please.

97
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,160
NERV.

98
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,250
<i>My father's work.</i>

99
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,210
Is there something I'm needed for?

100
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,420
Of course. He wouldn't send me a letter if he didn't need me for something.

101
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,840
I see, you don't get along with your father.

102
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,010
Me neither.

103
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,980
Amazing!

104
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,440
A real GeoFront!

105
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,150
That's right.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,690
And that is our secret base; NERV Headquarters.

107
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,490
It's humanity's fortress, the cornerstone to rebuilding our world.

108
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,750
Let's see... from the terminal's Western exit,

109
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,710
Go north to the 3rd gate and take a right.

110
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,750
Then, we need to take Route 8...

111
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,420
Could they have made this facility any more complicated?

112
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,010
Hmm... this looks like the correct route...

113
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,220
Um, are we lost?

114
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,350
I'm just not used to this place yet.

115
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,350
Either way, if we keep heading forward we'll eventually get there!

116
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,560
<i>Secondary cooling cycle complete.</i>

117
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,230
<i>All personnel, evacuate the tank immediately.</i>

118
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,690
I want the left arm's conductive plating defrosted and ready to go

119
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,780
within the next three minutes!

120
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,030
And don't forget that apoptosis data!

121
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,530
<i>Roger!</i>

122
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,990
Attention Professor Akagi: Chief Operations Officer Lt. Colonel Katsuragi,

123
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,660
together with one young boy, have arrived at Shaft S36.

124
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,080
What a surprise.

125
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,870
She's late yet again.

126
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,500
Ah... Ritsuko!

127
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,470
You're 12 minutes past schedule.

128
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,430
You were taking so long, I came to greet you personally, Lt. Colonel Katsuragi.

129
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,470
We're short on staff and out of time.

130
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,600
Eh... Sorry!

131
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,400
Is this the boy?

132
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,190
Yup.

133
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm the Chief Engineer and Administrator of NERV's Project E, Ritsuko Akagi.

134
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,440
It's nice to meet you.

135
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,200
M-me too.

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Well then, I'll leave things here to you.

137
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,750
It'll be their first meeting in 3 years...

138
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,210
Deputy Commander! The target has begun to move!

139
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,210
Understood.

140
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,210
All units, Level One battle stations!

141
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,010
<i>I repeat, all units, Level One battle stations!</i>

142
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,510
<i>Ground forces, prepare for combat!</i>

143
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,310
Ikari Shinij, there's something I want to show you.

144
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:35,070
The ultimate man-made multipurpose fighting machine. The artificial human, Evangelion.

145
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,940
That is Unit 01.

146
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,200
Mankind's very last trump card.

147
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,280
This is my father's work?

148
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,490
Correct.

149
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,330
It's been a while.

150
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,210
Father...

151
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,090
Prepare to sortie.

152
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,880
Sortie?!

153
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,340
But Unit 00 is still frozen, isn't it?

154
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,970
Unless... You intend to use Unit 01?

155
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,680
There is no other choice.

156
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,850
Shinji Ikari...?

157
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,310
Y-Yes?

158
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,980
You will pilot it.

159
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,110
Why did you call me here, Father?

160
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,990
For the same reason you're thinking.

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,570
I'm supposed to pilot this and fight that thing I just saw outside?

162
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,740
Correct.

163
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,700
I don't want to! What are you saying all of a sudden?!

164
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,660
I thought you didn't need me! That's why you left!

165
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,540
I need you now, so I called for you.

166
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,500
Why... me?

167
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,840
Because no one else can.

168
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,760
I can't do it...

169
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,390
I've never seen or heard of this thing.

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,850
I just can't!

171
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,260
We'll explain it to you.

172
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,930
No...

173
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,140
I can't do it!

174
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,940
There's no way I can do this!

175
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,190
If you're going to pilot it, do it now. If not...

176
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,270
Leave!

177
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,450
So, we've been found...

178
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,380
<i>Armored hulls 1 through 8 have been breeched!</i>

179
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Shinji, there isn't much time.

180
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,550
Widespread fire alarms in Block D. Closing all fire doors in the area.

181
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,840
Pilot it!

182
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,510
No!

183
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,760
...sure, I came all this way... but this is impossible!

184
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,270
Shinji, why did you come here?

185
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,150
Don't run away. You have to face your father... and more importantly, yourself.

186
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,200
I know that! But I just <i>can't</i>  do this!

187
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,660
Fuyutsuki.

188
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,710
Wake up Rei.

189
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,000
Can we use her?

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,080
She's not dead.

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,750
Understood.

192
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,420
Rei.

193
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Yes.

194
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,430
The backup is useless. We need you once more.

195
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,220
Yes.

196
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,310
Switch Unit 01's core unit to the L-00 type and reactivate it!

197
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,350
<i>Roger. Suspending current tasks. Reactivating.</i>

198
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,690
<i>Entering reactivation command.</i>

199
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,900
<i>I knew it. I was never needed...</i>

200
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,280
<i>The Target has broken through the final defense line,</i>

201
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,780
<i>and is proceeding to head right above us.</i>

202
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,190
Are you all right?

203
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,880
<i>I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away...</i>

204
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,800
<i>I mustn't run away!</i>

205
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,800
I'll do it.

206
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,550
I'll pilot it.

207
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,970
<i>Third cooling cycle, complete.</i>

208
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,520
<i>Flywheel rotation shutdown. </i>

209
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,810
<i>Unlocking the connectors.</i>

210
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,190
<i>No problems with the auxiliary power.</i>

211
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,520
Shutdown signal plug extraction complete.

212
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,440
<i>Roger, inserting entry plug.</i>

213
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,990
<i>Unlocking spinal conductive network. Prepare for connection.</i>

214
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,450
<i>Probe needle insertion complete.</i>

215
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,740
<i>Prime sync established. Psychological corruption values within acceptable range.</i>

216
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,330
<i>Maintaining range between plus-02 and minus-05.</i>

217
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,870
<i>Locking down interior array.</i>

218
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,960
<i>Roger, starting first contact.</i>

219
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,170
<i>Flooding Entry Plug.</i>

220
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,590
W-What is this?

221
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,220
It's all right.

222
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,560
Once the LCL fills your lungs, it will provide oxygen directly to your blood.

223
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,350
You'll get used to it.

224
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,770
<i>Main power source connection complete.</i>

225
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,440
<i>Roger.</i>

226
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
<i>Starting second contact.</i>

227
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,690
<i>Initializing interface.</i>

228
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,490
<i>A-10 nerve connection is normal.</i>

229
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,070
<i>LCL ionization levels normal.</i>

230
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,240
<i>Set Japanese as the linguistic norm for cognitive interface.</i>

231
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,120
<i>No problems detected with initial contacts.</i>

232
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,250
<i>Communication lines open.</i>

233
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,250
<i>Points on the list up to 1405, all clear.</i>

<i>Measuring synapse levels. Synchronization rate, 41.3%.</i>

235
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,130
And he's not even wearing a plug suit! Amazing!

236
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,350
Harmonics are in normal levels. Everything's under control.

237
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,350
We are ready!

238
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,350
Prepare to launch!

239
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,930
<i>Prepare to launch!</i>

240
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,690
<i>Release primary lock bolts!</i>

241
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,650
<i>Release confirmed.</i>

242
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,900
<i>Initiating retraction of umbilical bridge.</i>

243
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,110
<i>Release secondary lock bolts!</i>

244
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,870
<i>Removing primary restraints.</i>

245
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,410
<i>Proceeding to remove secondary restraints.</i>

246
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,630
<i>Disengaging safety systems 01 through 15.</i>

247
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,040
<i>Disengagement confirmed.</i>

248
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,630
<i>Unit 01 is now free.</i>

249
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,470
<i>Internal power supply, fully charged.</i>

250
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,380
<i>No problems with the external power socket.</i>

251
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Understood. Move Unit 01 to the launch pad.

252
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,640
<i>No problems with the positioning of any of the linear rail tracks.</i>

253
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,020
<i>Electromagnetic induction system, working normally.</i>

254
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,770
<i>Unit 01 is now moving to K-52.</i>

255
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,360
<i>Launch sequence is proceeding normally.</i>

256
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,690
<i>Eva has arrived at the launch terminal hub.</i>

257
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,330
Launch tube clear. All green!

258
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,830
Launch preparations complete.

259
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,500
Understood.

260
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,000
I have your approval?

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,210
Absolutely.

262
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,540
Our future depends on defeating the Angels.

263
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,420
Ikari, you're absolutely sure about this?

264
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,550
LAUNCH!

265
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,200
<i>Are you all right, Shinji?</i>

266
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,240
Y-Yes.

267
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,370
Release the final safety lock!

268
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,250
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!

269
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,130
Shinji...

270
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,300
<i>for now, just concentrate on walking.</i>

271
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
<i>Walk...</i>

272
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,770
It walked!

273
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,980
Walk...

274
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,120
<i>Shinji, stay alert!</i>

275
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,870
<i>Hurry... </i>

276
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,750
<i>Hurry and get back up!</i>

277
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,670
<i>Shinji, calm down!</i>

278
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,720
<i>It's not really your arm that's being hurt!</i>

279
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,890
What happened to Eva's defensive systems?

280
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,350
Signal inactive!

281
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,430
The field isn't expending.

282
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,140
It's not working?

283
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,980
<i>The left arm is damaged!</i>

284
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,360
<i>Circuits are going off-line!</i>
<i>The left arm is damaged!</i>

285
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,860
<i>Circuits are going off-line!</i>

286
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,740
Shinji, dodge!!

287
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,580
Frontal cranium is fracturing!

288
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,080
Its armor can't withstand much more!

289
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,670
Cranial damage, severity unknown!

290
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,380
<i>Operational integrity compromised!</i>

291
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,340
What's the status?

292
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,010
Synchro graph inverting! Pulse entering reflux!

293
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,930
Cut off the circuits! Block the flow!

294
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,600
We can't!

295
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,730
The signal's being refused, we can't get through!

296
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,600
Shinji's status?!

297
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
No response from the monitoring system. Condition unknown!

298
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,480
Unit 01 has gone silent.

299
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,310
Misato!

300
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,610
That's it!

301
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,190
Abort the operation! Pilot rescue has top priority!

302
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,700
Emergency plug ejection!

303
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,990
We can't! It's not responding!

304
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,320
What?!

305
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,040
<i>The Eva has reactivated!</i>

306
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,920
Impossible...

307
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,750
It should be knocked out!

308
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,960
Has it gone...

309
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,300
Berserk?!

310
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,690
We've won.

311
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,830
An AT-Field?

312
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,740
It's pointless. Unless the AT Field is breached...

313
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,330
...you can't do anything to an Angel.

314
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,590
Left arm restored!

315
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,130
Amazing!

316
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,090
Unit 01 has also raised an AT-Field!

317
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,310
Angel phase space is being neutralized.

318
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,430
No. It's corroding it.

319
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,810
It broke through that AT-Field like it was nothing...

320
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,210
What is Eva's status?

321
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,340
Is this Eva's...

322
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,260
True form?

323
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,230
Have you decided on a name?

324
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,320
If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl, then Rei.

325
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,990
Shinji...

326
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,490
Rei...

327
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,700
Shinji...

328
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,870
Shinji... Ayanami.

329
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,790
Shinji...

330
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
Rei...

331
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,500
Rei... Ikari...?

332
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,090
Rei...

333
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,050
No...

334
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,050
Ayanami... Rei!

335
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,280
An unfamiliar ceiling...

336
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,670
The attack of the fourth Angel, and its defeat...

337
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,010
Then the acquisition of the Third Child...

338
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,920
And the activation of Eva Unit 01...

339
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,380
Overall the plan is progressing well.

340
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,810
Well, except for the colossal expense necessary to repair Unit 01.

341
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,180
Compared to Unit 00 in cryo-suspension,

342
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,640
that is hardly a problem.

343
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,100
Eva Unit 01's recovery operation is complete.

344
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,730
Right now, it's being locked into Cage 6.

345
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,490
A full-systems check will commence at 10:00 hours.

346
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,280
And the recording from when it went berserk?

347
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,660
It was blank. Absolutely nothing was recorded.

348
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,410
And so, we have no idea what the cause was.

349
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,500
Our absolute confidence in its combat performance... may be a bit misplaced.

350
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,420
As long as it can fight the 5th Angel, minor bugs are tolerable.

351
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,920
No need for concern.

352
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,170
We'll continue deployment of Unit 01.

353
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,590
And Unit 02 and its pilot in Germany are under deployment qualification exams.

354
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,760
The construction of Unit 03 is also progressing as planned.

355
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,560
It's your responsibility to make proper use of NERV and the Evas.

356
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,100
We earnestly hope you will not disappoint us.

357
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,730
That's right. Defeating the Angels is but one step in fulfilling our contract with Lilith.

358
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,690
The Human Instrumentality Project...

359
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,570
Its execution is our ultimate goal.

360
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,080
I understand. Everything will go according to SEELE's scenario.

361
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,770
An Angel leaves quite a mark when it's destroyed after it loses its AT Field.

362
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,280
The blood is like a lake from hell...

363
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,740
It's got the same nasty feeling as the Second Impact.

364
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,610
Our Eva can defeat an Angel...

365
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,530
That alone will give humanity a glimmer of hope.

366
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,830
Well, looks the pilot of hope just woke up.

367
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,290
Paging Chief Internist Dr. Ugai. Dr. Ugai.

368
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,880
Please contact Dr. Azuma in the Emergency Surgical Ward as soon as possible.

369
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,970
The B Incident Grand Rounds will momentarily begin, according to schedule.

370
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,220
Would the event directors please make their way to conference room 2? Thank you.

371
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,660
Alone?

372
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,620
Yes, he's been assigned quarters in Block 6. That all right?

373
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,830
Yes.

374
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,790
Is that really okay?

375
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,130
Shinji?

376
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,090
It's fine. I'm always alone.

377
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,130
It's always the same wherever I go.

378
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,050
What?!

379
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,140
Like I was saying, I'm taking Shinji back to my place to live with me.

380
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,930
I have authorization from above.

381
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,270
Don't worry, I wouldn't lay a hand on a little boy like him.

382
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,230
Of course you won't! Honestly, what are you thinking?! Don't even say things like this!

383
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,360
She could never take a joke...

384
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,110
All right, we're gonna having a party tonight!

385
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,610
What for?

386
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,030
To welcome my new roommate, of course!

387
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,120
So you've decided to move?

388
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,210
Yes, I never thought this city would become a battlefield.

389
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,420
Indeed! My husband wants me and the children to leave here too!

390
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,470
I heard that just today, over 100 people left the city.

391
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,690
This may be a fortress city, but those people at NERV seem rather incompetent.

392
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,400
I get chills just thinking about what happened yesterday.

393
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,020
I know...

394
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,490
Sorry,

395
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,360
but we're going to take a slight detour.

396
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,320
Where to?

397
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,660
Someplace special.

398
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,170
This city...

399
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,960
...seems so lonely, doesn't it?

400
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,050
It's time.

401
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,580
Amazing...

402
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,670
Buildings are sprouting out of the ground!

403
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,360
This is the special fortress-city for intercepting Angels.

404
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,610
Tokyo-3.

405
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,780
This is our city...

406
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,740
And the city that you protected.

407
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,330
Looks like your things have already been delivered.

408
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,920
To tell the truth, I've only moved to this city recently.

409
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,550
All right, come on in.

410
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,300
Um...

411
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,800
Pardon the intrusion.

412
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,350
Shinji, this is your home now.

413
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,610
I'm... I'm home.

414
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,360
Welcome home.

415
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,070
Ah yeah...

416
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,370
It's a little messy in here, but try to ignore it.

417
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,330
Is this...

418
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,040
...a little?

419
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,370
Oh sorry, could you put the food in the fridge please?

420
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,040
Ah, sure!

421
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,840
Ice...

422
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,710
Snacks...

423
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,130
And nothing but beer?

424
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,010
What kind of life does she lead?

425
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,180
Let's dig in!

426
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,220
Let's eat...

427
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,400
Ah, I love it! This is what makes life worth living!

428
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,780
Not hungry? For instant food, it's pretty good.

429
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,080
Well... I'm just not used to this sort of meal.

430
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,870
No! You just can't be so picky!

431
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,500
No, that's not it... Um...

432
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,170
Isn't this fun...?

433
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,470
Having a meal with another person?

434
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,930
Uh... yes.

435
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,550
All right!

436
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:34,390
Since this is your home now, feel free to just let loose!

437
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,350
Y-Yes...

438
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,850
Come on... This "Yes, yes, yes, yes." is getting on my nerves...

439
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,900
You're a boy aren't you?! Show some backbone, will you!

440
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,530
Yes.

441
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,150
Well, whatever.

442
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,030
Once you'll get in the bath, all those bad feelings will just wash away in an instant!

443
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,160
Bathing lets you wash your life anew.

444
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,210
M-M-Misato!

445
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,510
What?

446
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,350
Ah, him? He's my pet bird. They call them hot spring penguins.

447
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,820
Birds like that actually exist?!

448
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:30,280
They used to be a lot more common 15 years ago.
His name is Pen-pen.

449
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,660
He'll be your other roommate in this house.

450
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,870
Anyway... shouldn't you be covering that?

451
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,420
<i>Maybe I'm being overly flamboyant... he might be able to see right through me.</i>

452
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,800
<i>Misato Katsuragi...</i>

453
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
<i>She's not a bad person.</i>

454
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,430
<i>Bathing lets you wash your life anew!</i>

455
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,270
I tend to remember bad things when I'm in a bath...

456
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,690
How was Rei doing?

457
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,700
You went to her hospital this afternoon, no?

458
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,410
There are no problems. Preparing to restart the frozen Unit 00 is more important.

459
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,000
Are you sure about using your son? His mental state seems to be very unstable.

460
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,500
Don't worry about him. His condition will give us the perfect pretext to reinstate Unit 00.

461
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,420
We'll proceed according to Lt. Colonel Katsuragi's suggestion, then.

462
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,650
<i>Even without a preliminary report, they suddenly selected him as the Third Child.</i>

463
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,990
<i>And as if in response, the Fourth Angel attacks.</i>

464
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,200
<i>In addition, Commander Ikari forces his son to pilot.</i>

465
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,370
<i>I certainly feel very uneasy about that fact...</i>

466
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,710
<i>But still, even after successfully defeating that Angel, I feel surprisingly...</i>

467
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,540
unhappy.

468
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,710
<i>Another unfamiliar ceiling...</i>

469
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,630
<i>No surprise...</i>

470
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,930
<i>Nothing about this city is familiar.</i>

471
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,010
<i>This is your home now.</i>

472
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,350
<i>Why am I even here?</i>

473
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,740
Shinji? I'm coming in.

474
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,290
I forgot to tell you something.

475
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,590
You've done a wonderful thing worth praising today.

476
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,630
You should be proud.

477
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,590
Goodnight, Shinji.

478
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,680
Hang in there.

479
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,100
Sorry, transfer kid. I had to hit ya.

480
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,770
To settle the score with you.

481
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,320
Real sorry. That guy's little sister was injured in that big incident the other day.

482
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,360
That's just how it is with him.

483
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,780
It's not like I piloted it because I wanted to.

484
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,020
<i>How is this something people would praise me for?</i>

485
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,730
<i>Why do I have to get hit just because I piloted the Eva?</i>

486
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,230
Is everything all right, Shinji?

487
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,940
Yes.

488
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,490
Within each Angel there is a central core.

489
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,160
The only way to defeat an Angel directly is to destroy that core.

490
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,120
Therefore, center on target, then pull the trigger.

491
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,840
This way, you can dispose of them accurately if you master the process.

492
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,380
Okay.

493
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,020
Good. Continue practicing like this in induction mode.

494
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,770
Okay.

495
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,990
Still, I'm quite surprised Shinji suddenly changed his mind about piloting...

496
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,620
That boy only gets through life by silently obeying whatever people tell him, doesn't he?

497
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,000
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

498
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,460
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

499
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,460
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

500
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,300
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

501
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,430
Which reminds me...

502
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,600
Wasn't Shinji hit by one of his classmates at his new school?

503
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,060
Is our pilot security sufficient?

504
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,060
There's no problem with our intelligence department's surveillance.

505
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,980
Besides, it wasn't very bad.

506
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,940
It would better if we stayed out of his private life.

507
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,820
Doesn't he live with you?

508
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,240
His maintenance is your responsibility too, you know.

509
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,900
That's just it.

510
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,070
It's difficult... He's far more naïve than I expected.

511
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,950
Hah, complaining already?

512
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,620
You were the one who was so adamant about taking him in.

513
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,080
Quiet, you.

514
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:43,010
You're right, he doesn't have much of a personality for making friends.

515
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,050
Have you heard of the "Hedgehog's dilemma"?

516
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,270
Hedgehog? The little spiky things?

517
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,520
Hedgehogs have a hard time sharing warmth with other hedgehogs.

518
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,650
The closer they become, the more they hurt each other.

519
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,780
People are like that as well.

520
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,070
Like with Shinji right now.

521
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,410
The more pain his heart endures, the more afraid he becomes.

522
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,790
Well, eventually he'll realize.

523
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:20,840
Becoming an adult means drawing close and growing apart over and over...

524
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,550
...and discovering the way to avoid wounding one another.

525
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,760
I certainly hope so.

526
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,020
Anyway, when are we gonna get budget approval to upgrade Block B here?

527
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,310
Eva's maintenance and armaments are the top priority.

528
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,980
Maybe there's no money left?

529
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,400
My ass is freezing!

530
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,580
An emergency call...

531
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,290
I'll go on ahead.

532
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,640
<i>We have direct visual of inbound object.</i>

533
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,680
<i>E747 has also confirmed the object.</i>

534
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,190
Analysis indicates Pattern Blue. There's no doubt. It's the fifth Angel.

535
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,560
All hands, level one battle stations!

536
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,440
<i>Roger, ground-to-air missiles ready!</i>.

537
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,070
<i>Tokyo-3 entering combat configuration.</i>

538
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,570
<i>Retracting central block.</i>

539
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,630
<i>Center block and Districts One through Seven's retraction is complete.</i>

540
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,300
<i>All governmental departments have been notified.</i>

541
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Target continuing inbound movement.</i>

542
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,220
<i>The anti-air interception system is 48% activated.</i>

543
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,970
Status of noncombatants and civilians?

544
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,640
We've already received a complete evacuation report.

545
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,940
<i>All Elementary and Middle School student classes, please gather in your designated blocks.</i>

546
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,280
There is a lost child at shelter number 323 in Sector Seven.

547
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,070
It's happening again.
There is a lost child at shelter number 323 in Sector Seven.

548
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,990
Just text again?
There is a lost child at shelter number 323 in Sector Seven.

549
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,070
There is a lost child at shelter number 323 in Sector Seven.

550
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,740
They're controlling the broadcast.

551
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,120
They won't show us regular citizens anything.

552
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,410
Not even a big event like this!

553
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,380
This is a waste of tax money.

554
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,050
Some people just aren't happy unless they burn through some ammo.

555
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,890
The Japanese government is demanding we send out the Evangelion.

556
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,270
How annoying. It's not like we weren't going to do that without their orders.

557
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,730
<i>We've started the entry. Ionizing LCL.</i>

558
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,860
<i>Father's not even watching me... Why am I piloting this again?</i>

559
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,860
<i>People hate me for this...</i>

560
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,620
Hey, I wanna talk to you about something, alone.

561
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,700
What about?

562
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,370
Just for a minute, okay?

563
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,660
All right, all right...

564
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,250
Right, right, and then-

565
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,500
Class Rep!

566
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,080
What?

567
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,340
We, uh, both need to take a leak!

568
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,050
Geez, make it quick!!

569
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,300
So, what's this about?

570
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,220
I want to see it at least once before I die!

571
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,300
That battle up there?

572
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,270
This is the real deal! If I don't go now, who knows when I'll get another chance...

573
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,770
Jeez, Kensuke, what is it with you?

574
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,100
"If you waste this moment, you may waste everything."

575
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,070
Come on... Just help me get past the gate.

576
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,860
Guess I've got no choice. You're a real slave to your passions, aren't you?

577
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,240
<i>Shinji, are you ready for launch?</i>

578
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,660
Yes.

579
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,670
<i>Remember. Continuous Gatling gun fire as you neutralize its AT Field.</i>

580
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,790
<i>Just like in practice. You'll be fine.</i>

581
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:27,710
Yes...

582
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,540
Launch!

583
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,940
Incredible! This was worth the trouble!

584
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,360
Yes! This is what I've been waiting for!

585
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,820
It's here.

586
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,160
<i>Expanding A.T. Field.</i>
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

587
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,330
Center on target, then pull the trigger.
<i>Expanding A.T. Field.</i>

588
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,330
<i>Proceed according to the plans, okay, Shinji?</i>
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

589
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:02,540
<i>Proceed according to the plans, okay, Shinji?</i>

590
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,580
Yes.

591
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,510
Idiot! All that smoke is obscuring the target!

592
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,310
The heck? He's gettin' his ass kicked!

593
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,270
He's fine!

594
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,520
We're sending up a spare rifle!

595
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,740
<i>Grab it!</i>

596
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,740
<i>Shinji...? Shinji?!</i>

597
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,240
Oh man... Your beating must have shaken him up.

598
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,330
Sh-Shut up!

599
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,810
Umbillical Cable has been severed!

600
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,770
Eva switching to internal power supply!

601
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,520
Operational time remaining is 4 minutes 53 seconds!

602
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,780
It's coming this way!

603
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,280
<i>Shinji, are you all right?! Shinji!</i>

604
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,290
<i>Damage report?</i>

605
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,080
<i>No problems. He's good to go.</i>

606
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,380
Shinji's classmates?!

607
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,550
What are they doing there?!

608
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,190
Why isn't he fighting back?!

609
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,440
Maybe he can't move freely... because we're here!?

610
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,190
<i>Unit 01 will reach operational time limit in 3 minutes 28 seconds!</i>

611
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,950
<i>Palm armor overheating. Damage, 58%.</i>

612
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,160
<i>Shinji, let those two into the cockpit!</i>

613
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,750
Once they're in, get out of there! We'll start over afterwards.

614
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,790
<i>You two, get in, quickly!</i>

615
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,670
What the-- Is this water?!

616
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,590
My camera! My camera!

617
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,340
<i>System restarting.</i>
My camera! My camera!

618
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:21,970
<i>System restarting.</i>

619
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,930
<i>Palm surface meltdown has reached the 3rd protective layer!</i>

620
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,440
Now's your chance! Retreat!

621
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,320
<i>Use escape route 34. Retreat on the eastern side of the mountain.</i>

622
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,530
Hey, transfer kid, she said "retreat!"
<i>Use escape route 34. Retreat on the eastern side of the mountain.</i>

623
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,530
Hey, transfer kid, she said "retreat!"

624
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,200
I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away...

625
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,160
Transfer kid!
I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away...

626
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,460
I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away...

627
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,500
Progressive Knife equipped!

628
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,420
<i>Shinji, listen to my order! Fall back now!</i>

629
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,470
<i>Shinji!</i>

630
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,890
That idiot!

631
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,040
Unit 01 will reach operational time limit in 30 seconds.

632
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,540
28, 27, 26...

633
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,340
25, 24, 23, 22...

634
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,800
13, 12, 11, 10...

635
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,430
9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

636
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,560
4, 3, 2, 1...

637
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,650
Eva Unit 01 has ceased operation.

638
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,530
Target has completely disintegrated.

639
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,820
Why did you ignore my orders?

640
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,830
I'm sorry.

641
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,660
I am your operational supervisor, am I not?

642
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:55,950
Yes.

643
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,210
It's your duty to follow the orders I give you.

644
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,460
Do you understand?

645
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,630
Yes.

646
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,090
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

647
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:05,590
Yes.

648
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,630
Do you really understand what I'm telling you?

649
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,930
Yes, I understand, Misato.

650
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,220
It's fine, we won, didn't we?

651
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,190
I'll pilot it if you tell me to. Isn't that what you want?

652
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,790
That's enough. Go back and get some rest.

653
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,480
Next stop is Nagao Pass. Nagao Pass.

654
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,730
Please exit to the right.

655
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,320
He doesn't plan on coming home...

656
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,110
That idiot.

657
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Ikari, Shinji Ikari.

658
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,170
What's this? He just got here, and he's already absent?

659
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,260
Oh well. Now then, I'll hand back the tests from the other day.

660
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,920
I've had enough of this!

661
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,090
Please take me back to Misato!

662
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,990
Did your little stroll clear things up for you, Shinji Ikari?

663
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,960
Not really. It didn't really matter. Nothing does.

664
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,920
I don't have any freedom anyway.

665
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,090
I have no choice but to pilot Eva, do I?

666
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,430
That's the only reason my father called for me, after all.

667
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,060
Fine. I'll pilot it.

668
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,060
If that's what everyone wants, that's what I'll do.

669
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,440
You talk about everyone else, but what about yourself?

670
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,900
I know I can't do this. I bet everybody else does, too.

671
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,990
But Ayanami is hurt, and you and father want...

672
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,280
Cut it out!

673
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,620
This has nothing to do with anyone else!

674
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:47,910
You need to decide if you want to be the pilot for the Eva.

675
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,910
You're free to go if you want to.

676
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,250
You have all the freedom you want. Do as you please!

677
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,590
In the end, your son's actions followed the plan to the letter.

678
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,560
Yes. Next we must make him and Rei get closer.

679
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,060
All is according to plan.

680
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,230
A scenario written out 14 years ago.

681
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,440
These poor children's fates have already been determined.

682
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,940
Don't you find that a bit harsh?

683
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,410
C'mon, hurry it up! And don't hold back!

684
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,540
If you don't do this, I won't feel like it's settled!

685
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,080
Well, that's just the kind of straightforward guy he is. I'm counting on you.

686
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,800
Now we're even. I'm sorry for hitting you, Ikari.

687
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,650
Go, go, Kayoko!

688
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,110
If you lose, you're buying us a pizza!

689
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,280
That's it! Go, go, go!

690
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,070
In your dreams!!

691
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,780
Please! Give me one more chance!!

692
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,240
Ew, the boys are peeping!
Please! Give me one more chance!!

693
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,120
Ew, the boys are peeping!

694
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:08,790
Pervs!

695
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,870
That's naughty!

696
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,750
Suzuhara's gaze is so lewd!

697
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,670
Ikari~!

698
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,960
Rei Ayanami, age 14.

699
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,130
She was the first candidate chosen by the Marduk Institute.

700
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,630
The First Child.

701
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:29,260
Specifically, she is the exclusive operator of the prototype Evangelion, Unit 00.

702
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,180
Her personal history is blank. Completely erased.

703
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,650
So, to save her, my father...

704
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,020
Critical error in startup system!

705
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,690
<i>Failures in Stage 3 routines!</i>

706
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,070
<i>Nervous system elements rejected.</i>

707
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,900
<i>The main transmission system is scrambled! It's overflowing!</i>

708
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,530
Neural pulse flow reversing! I'm unable to stop it!

709
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,660
Direct camera feed, down!

710
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,660
Entry plug unstable. Eva is refusing to release it!

711
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,870
Abort contacts. Close off all circuits up to number six.

712
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,540
I can't! The signal won't go through!

713
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,590
Unit 00 is out of control!

714
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,880
Abort the test. Cut all power.

715
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,840
Yes, sir!

716
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,970
Unit 00 has switched to auxiliary power.

717
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,350
35 seconds to total system shutdown.

718
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,270
<i>Failsafe system has yet to activate.</i>

719
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,190
It's dangerous! Please step back!

720
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,200
The auto-eject has activated!

721
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:29,780
Oh no!

722
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,750
<i>We still cannot control Unit 00!</i>

723
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,080
Quickly, release specialized Bakelite!

724
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:40,250
Rei!

725
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,880
Ten seconds to complete shutdown!

726
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,890
8, 7, 6, 5...

727
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,470
4, 3, 2, 1.

728
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,810
Unit 00 has ceased all activity.

729
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,700
Rei, are you all right?

730
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,370
Rei!

731
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,040
That's good.

732
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,050
It was so sudden. I couldn't believe it.

733
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:34,060
It was deleted from the official report, but it's an undisputed fact.

734
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:38,060
Unit 00 just went berserk, and is still being unfrozen.

735
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,560
Isn't that a bit hasty?

736
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,980
The Angels have reappeared. It's our top priority to reinforce our military strength.

737
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,610
That's true, but...

738
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,700
We've already run reactivation tests with Rei.

739
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,610
Unit 00 itself is ready.

740
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,580
Once the adjustments to the nerve connections are complete.

741
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,500
It's so we can re-deploy it soon, isn't it?

742
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,750
Ayanami...

743
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,300
Why is she always alone?

744
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,840
<i>Eva Unit 01 is beginning third coolant phase.</i>

745
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,930
<i>Please set all systems in Cage 6 to phase three.</i>

746
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:19,770
<i>Copying the all-range data of the entry plug to Melchior. Data sent.</i>

747
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,520
<i>Begin third cooling phase.</i>

748
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,940
<i>Copying situation data from Casper to Melchior.</i>

749
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,780
<i>Currently, Unit 01's plug depth is at 0.8. It's within acceptable measurement range.</i>

750
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,700
<i>T-minus 150 minutes to Unit 00's conductive systems restart and testing.</i>

751
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:40,290
<i>Roger. Routine synchronization test, Program 508 is now complete.</i>

752
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,750
<i>Good work, Shinji.</i>

753
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,630
So, what's it like living with him?

754
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,340
It's all right. I'm getting used to it.

755
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,010
Still a little nervous?

756
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,180
It's not your first time living with a man, is it?

757
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,720
This isn't like 8 years ago.

758
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,720
This time, it's not an intimate relationship.

759
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,970
I don't know about that...

760
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,640
Shinji is still here because of you, isn't he?

761
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,150
You're wrong there.

762
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,900
It's probably because his father's here.

763
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,490
He wants his father to acknowledge him.
To pat him on the shoulder.

764
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:16,120
To praise him, even if it's just one word.

765
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,740
I think he wants a love that will wipe away his loneliness.

766
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:24,870
He's conflicted over his father, just like you are, Misato.

767
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,510
I wonder why Commander Ikari acts so distant with his own son.

768
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,510
And it looks like he talks to Rei a lot.

769
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,880
It's a terrible balance.

770
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:38,890
Lately, it seems like men have no interest in anything other than themselves.

771
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,970
It's a tough time to be a woman, isn't it?

772
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,940
Well, then...

773
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,690
It's about time. I have to head back.

774
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,480
You're a worker bee, as always.

775
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,240
Take these if you're going home, Misato. It's Shinji's official security card,

776
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,160
...and Rei Ayanami's renewed card.

777
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,330
I forgot about these.

778
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:02,120
Could you ask Shinji to give this to her?

779
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,790
All right.

780
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:09,750
Rei Ayanami...

781
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,470
Why was father smiling with her...?

782
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,930
Why won't he smile for me?

783
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,090
Excuse me...

784
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,890
Excuse me, it's Ikari!

785
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,390
Ayanami, I'm coming in.

786
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:39,760
Could these be Ayanami's?

787
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,610
Oh, no... Um... I...!

788
00:59:58,650 --> 00:59:59,900
I didn't mean to...

789
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,940
Could you move?

790
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,570
U-um...!

791
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,000
What is it?

792
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,720
Um... I was... Um...

793
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,090
That is...

794
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,930
I... I was asked to... I mean...

795
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,140
The uhhh...

796
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:17,900
The card! The c-card was renewed and... and I c-came to deliver it...

797
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:24,110
So... So... It's not like I was trying to...

798
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:35,040
Ritsuko said she forgot to give it to you. Honestly.

799
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,920
I rang the doorbell, but no one answered... and the door was unlocked, so...

800
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,730
Offices in the Central Dogma are currently accessible.

801
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,270
Group 3 visitors are requested to please use Direct Gate 4.

802
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:06,240
Here's your new card, Ayanami. Ritsuko left it with me.

803
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,120
Sorry about before.

804
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,080
What for?

805
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,630
Say, Ayanami... Aren't you afraid?

806
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:27,760
About piloting that Evangelion again.

807
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,720
Why should I be?

808
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,270
I heard you got hurt in that test...

809
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:37,350
So... Are you really okay?

810
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,520
Yes. I'm okay.

811
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:46,030
But... aren't you afraid it will go berserk again?

812
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:50,450
Or we could lose to an Angel and die!

813
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,950
You're Commander Ikari's son, aren't you?

814
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,710
You don't have faith in your father's work?

815
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,710
Of course not! Not from a father like him.

816
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,220
Um...

817
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,200
<i>Monitored object is proceeding past the Odawara defense Line.</i>

818
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,240
<i>Object analysis complete.</i>

819
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:35,330
Pattern blue. Angel confirmed.

820
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,910
As we thought. The 6th Angel.

821
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,420
Yes.

822
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,830
Prepare Unit 01 for sortie.

823
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,960
<i>Prepare to launch Unit 01!</i>

824
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,840
<i>Anti-air interception weapons armed.</i>

825
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,800
The target is passing above Lake Ashinoko.

826
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,720
Evangelion Unit 01 is ready to launch!

827
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,560
Launch!

828
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,900
High energy reaction detected inside the target!

829
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,530
What?!

830
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,280
Don't tell me...!

831
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,110
Get out of there!

832
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,470
Lower synchronization rate to minimum!

833
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,640
Deploy blast shield!

834
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,700
Abort intercept! Begin emergency recovery of Unit 01!

835
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,290
We can't! The catapult has melted. It's unusable!

836
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,460
What about the AT-Field?

837
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,960
Fully raised. Structural integrity is holding, but barely!

838
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,470
<i>No! No more of this!</i>

839
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,470
<i>Let me out! Get me out of here, father!!</i>

840
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,720
Abort the operation!

841
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,770
Place top priority on the pilot's safety! Force eject the plug!

842
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,810
That won't do.

843
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:27,820
If the pilot is taken out, Eva's AT-Field will completely disappear!

844
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,400
Things will go from bad to worse.

845
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,110
But...

846
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,330
There's no other choice...

847
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:44,710
Emergency recovery! Blow the explosive bolts!

848
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:08,480
<i>The target has ceased fire.</i>

849
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,770
<i>Unit 01 retrieved. Sending to Cage 99!</i>

850
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:11,820
<i>Rescue team, stand by!</i>

851
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,110
First priority is cooling the LCL in the plug!

852
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,110
Pilot confirmed! His heart rate is weak.

853
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,370
Boost plug suit life support to max! Begin cardiac massage!

854
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:19,830
Understood!

855
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,040
Pulse confirmed!

856
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,370
Forcefully eject the plug!

857
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,340
<i>Stabilizing possible rupture point in the interior.</i>

858
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,000
Begin emergency LCL draining!

859
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,300
At once!

860
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,880
<i>Draining LCL.</i>

861
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,050
Hurry emergency treatment!

862
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,550
The target is currently invading from above.

863
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,930
It's in the midst of drilling through to the Geo-Front.

864
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:22,890
Its objective is a direct attack on our NERV HQ, is it?

865
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:26,180
Well then, let's hear the results of each department's analysis.

866
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,480
Judging from the previous battle...

867
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,940
...the target automatically engages any enemy within a certain range.

868
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,150
Meaning it's impossible for Eva to engage it in close combat, right?

869
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,490
How's its AT Field?

870
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,740
Still operational. And to make matters worse...

871
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:43,240
with its phase pattern constantly shifting, the field's surface is unstable.

872
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,370
Neutralizing it will be very difficult.

873
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,370
According to Magi's calculations...

874
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,210
...to pierce the enemy's AT Field,

875
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:56,420
we'd need to drop so many aerial N2 Mines that it would destroy NERV HQ as well.

876
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,510
The Magi 2 at Matsushiro reached the same conclusion.

877
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:05,930
Right now, the Japanese government and U.N. Forces are petitioning NERV HQ to do just that.

878
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:08,600
An easy suggestion to make when they're not the ones in danger.

879
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,440
If this place falls, then all is lost.

880
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,940
However, the drill has already breached the second layer of armor plating.

881
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,650
It's already begun penetrating the third.

882
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:22,870
The estimated time from today until it has passed through all 22 layers,

883
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:28,290
reaching the area above HQ, is 12:06:54 AM tomorrow morning.

884
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,580
We have ten hours and fourteen minutes.

885
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,920
To make matters worse, Unit 00 needs to be calibrated before it's operational.

886
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,880
Unit 01 is also currently unmovable due to its previous injury.

887
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,630
The situation sure isn't favorable.

888
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:44,140
We're certainly backed into a corner.

889
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:46,260
Should we wave the white flag?

890
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:51,730
Maybe... but before we do, I have a little something I'd like to try.

891
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:55,900
The intelligence division should be aware of the JSSDF's secret weapon, right?

892
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:16,420
Still, though, it's reckless to use this in an operation, Operations Chief Katsuragi.

893
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,340
"Reckless" is a bit rude.

894
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,840
It can be done within the remaining nine hours, and it's the best shot we've got.

895
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,550
Operation Yashima...

896
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:29,100
As the name suggests, we'll be taking electrical power from all over Japan.

897
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:35,480
And then direct it toward JSSDF's secret prototype weapon, a high power positron cannon.

898
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:43,530
Since it's unfinished, and can't be used on its own, it's been modified for Eva to control it.

899
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:50,290
Convincing the U.N. Forces is one thing, but the Ministry of Home Affairs and JSSDF, too?

900
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:54,000
Let's just say they owe me a few favors.

901
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:59,130
You sure are good at what you do.

902
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:06,640
From midnight tonight to before dawn tomorrow, the entire country will experience a large-scale blackout.

903
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,930
We ask for everyone's cooperation. I repeat...

904
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:17,310
From midnight tonight to before dawn tomorrow, the entire country will experience a large-scale blackout.

905
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:17,650
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

906
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,480
All right. Let's go.
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

907
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:19,770
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

908
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,270
Yeah.
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

909
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:27,280
From midnight tonight to before dawn tomorrow, the entire country will experience a large-scale blackout.

910
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,240
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

911
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,310
<i>The Angel has penetrated through the 7th armored plate!</i>

912
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,020
What's the status of our energy system?

913
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,110
<i>Power will be fed directly from the Shingotenba substation and two backup generators!</i>

914
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:05,860
<i>Superconductor power lines now being laid towards lower Futagoyama.</i>

915
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:11,450
<i>The transformer relay system is scheduled to be up and running at 10:50 PM Japan time.</i>

916
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,370
How's progress on the sniping system?

917
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,540
No problems in assembly. We'll have no trouble making it by the operation start time.

918
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,210
What is Unit 01's status?

919
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,540
It's currently being outfitted with G-type sniping equipment.

920
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,710
It will be ready to deploy in two hours.

921
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,510
Roger that! All that's left now is the pilot.

922
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,350
But I wonder... Will he be willing to pilot it again?

923
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,390
What do you plan to do about Unit 01's pilot?

924
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:40,730
It's too soon to test the dummy plug system.

925
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,400
We have no other practical means other than letting the current pilot handle it.

926
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,650
In the worst case, do we brainwash him?

927
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:50,280
If things don't work out, there's always Rei.

928
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:54,990
Rei in Unit 01? Isn't that a bit too risky?

929
01:11:55,740 --> 01:12:01,170
We must use whatever means are available to us.
We still have eight Angels we must defeat.

930
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,880
And then, we realize our goal...

931
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:16,260
<i>I hate it... piloting the Eva.</i>

932
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:21,690
<i>If I do it well, no one praises me for doing it.</i>

933
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:25,230
<i>If I fail, everyone will hate me. Or, even worse, I could just die.</i>

934
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,980
<i>Why am I even here?</i>

935
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,240
<i>I thought things would change here.
That maybe good things would happen.</i>

936
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,490
<i>I didn't come here to be put through hell.</i>

937
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,710
<i>So you plan to spend the rest of your life running away from everything unpleasant?</i>

938
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,540
<i>Live?</i>

939
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,710
<i>Why am I alive, anyway?</i>

940
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,340
<i>I used to think I didn't have a choice in the matter.</i>

941
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:55,890
<i>Whether it's my father or Misato, no one really needs me.</i>

942
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:58,350
<i>If I couldn't pilot Eva, there would be no need for me.</i>

943
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,980
<i>That's why I have no choice but to pilot Eva.</i>

944
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,270
<i>That's why I'm able to stay here.</i>

945
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,780
<i>But when I pilot my Eva, I...</i>

946
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:14,990
This ceiling again...

947
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,040
Is this all I get for piloting that thing?

948
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,500
Ayanami...?

949
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,500
You were here the whole time?

950
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,260
I'm here to tell you about the schedule for Operation Yashima, which will commence at midnight tomorrow.

951
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:41,390
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami are to report at Terminal 2 at 19:30.

952
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:46,440
At 20:00, Unit 01, accompanied by Unit 00, will be transferred.

953
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,730
Launch is scheduled at 20:05.

954
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:51,740
By 20:30, they will arrive at the 2nd Futagoyama fortress.

955
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,030
After that, they will await further orders.

956
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,990
When the clock strikes midnight, the operation will begin.

957
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,200
Your food.

958
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,040
I don't feel like eating anything.

959
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,580
We leave in 90 minutes.

960
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,800
You're saying I'll be piloting that thing again?

961
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,590
Yes.

962
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:16,130
I don't want to. I don't want to feel that scared anymore.

963
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:20,510
It's terrifying...! But I can't even run away...

964
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:22,220
You're afraid of Eva?

965
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,770
Then stay and rest.

966
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,400
Rest?

967
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,900
I will pilot Unit 01.

968
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,280
Ayanami!

969
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,450
Farewell.

970
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,340
<i>The Angel is penetrating through the 17th armored plate!</i>

971
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:57,220
<i>Target will reach NERV Headquarters in 4 minutes 55 seconds.</i>

972
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:01,720
<i>The new western Hakone line and the southern Tounosawa overhead line have been electrified.</i>

973
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:06,230
<i>Currently, the number 16 substation is continuing to establish its transformer equipment.</i>

974
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:11,480
<i>500,000 volts are flowing through the transformers as planned. No changes to the time sheet.</i>

975
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,280
<i>The 28th transformer group will arrive after a five minute delay.</i>

976
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,410
<i>All related persons, please hurry to your respective lines.</i>

977
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:23,790
<i>Begin proceeding to Stage Four of the simulation. Now re-checking recovery and support systems.</i>

978
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:30,250
<i>All SMES have been set up. Sequential startup from the first bundle confirmed.</i>

979
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:35,590
<i>All mega-high voltage superconductor transformers' opening and closing checks complete. No problems.</i>

980
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,850
So this is the giant positron cannon?

981
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:50,980
The assembly was rushed, but theoretically it should work.

982
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,150
We're zeroing the alignment on our end and getting it ready to link with the G-type equipment.

983
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,240
And, well, the rest is up to you.

984
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:00,070
You mean up to the pilot.

985
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,280
Misato, I sure hope this works.

986
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,830
Shinji, you were supposed to report long ago.

987
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:18,010
You chose to stay here, didn't you?

988
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:21,130
Then do your job properly.

989
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,720
I'm afraid of piloting the Eva...

990
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,640
You and the others have nothing to be afraid of.

991
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:33,060
You're always just giving orders from your base underground.

992
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,610
I'm the only one experiencing these terrifying things.

993
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:37,690
You all are hypocrites.

994
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,410
Come with me for a sec.

995
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,040
Fifteen years ago,

996
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:00,590
half of humanity died in the Second Impact.

997
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:04,550
If the Angels cause a Third Impact now,

998
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:07,810
humanity will die out. No one will survive.

999
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,890
I've heard this story countless times already.

1000
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:19,900
If an Angel ever reaches Level EEE of NERV Headquarters...

1001
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:23,780
an automatic self-destruct would commence.

1002
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:30,580
We will sacrifice ourselves to prevent the Third Impact from happening.

1003
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:34,620
Everyone who works here understands and accepts that risk.

1004
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:53,890
This is...

1005
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,900
It can't be... An Eva...!?

1006
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:05,320
Not quite. The bringer of life to this planet, and the agent of its extinction...

1007
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,620
The Second Angel, Lilith.

1008
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,780
Lilith...?

1009
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:13,620
Yes. Some believe it will act as the trigger for the Third Impact.

1010
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,540
We fight with the Evas to protect Lilith.

1011
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,710
That is something that only you can do.

1012
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,630
We're entrusting the future of humanity to you and the Eva.

1013
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:30,060
And why give me that painful responsibility?

1014
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,810
No reason. Fate chose you, that's all.

1015
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,730
But you're not the only one putting your life on the line here, Shinji.

1016
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,610
We all are.

1017
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,200
I'll pilot it... one more time...

1018
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,680
I will now inform you of your roles in this operation.

1019
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,680
Shinji.

1020
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,430
Yes?

1021
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,600
You will act as gunner in Unit 01.

1022
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Yes.

1023
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,980
Rei, you and Unit 00 will be on defense.

1024
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,270
Yes.

1025
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:21,110
The operation this time calls for utmost precision.

1026
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,780
That's why, instead of the uncalibrated Unit 00,

1027
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,650
we chose to use Unit 01, even though it's still undergoing repairs.

1028
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,660
Listen, Shinji.

1029
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:35,660
Because of the Earth's rotation, magnetic field, and gravity, the positron cannon won't fire straight.

1030
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,120
Don't forget to take those factors into account.

1031
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:41,460
You must strike the core in a single shot.

1032
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,170
But I don't know where this one's core is.

1033
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:49,550
Don't worry. There's a portion that materializes during its attack phase.

1034
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,800
We believe that's where its core is located.

1035
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,230
Your sniping position, as well as various factors that affect your trajectory, will all be inputted by us.

1036
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:04,070
Thus, all you have to do is to follow the on-screen prompts, and fire when the center indicators meet.

1037
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,360
The machine will handle the rest.

1038
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:13,990
However only one spot has been set up to supply all of this power.

1039
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:17,700
For that reason, Unit 01 cannot change its firing position.

1040
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:20,420
Retreating isn't an option, then?

1041
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,210
Correct.

1042
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,630
So what if I miss, and the Angel shoots back?

1043
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:29,630
Don't concern yourself with unnecessary thoughts now. Focus on destroying the target in one shot.

1044
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,890
If I don't, we'll be in a big pinch, huh?

1045
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,220
I... I am supposed to protect Unit 01?

1046
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:37,720
Yes.

1047
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,060
Understood.

1048
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,100
It's time. Both of you, get dressed.

1049
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:43,150
Yes.
Yes.

1050
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,240
You know...

1051
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,410
we might die this time.

1052
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:01,460
No.

1053
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,920
You won't die.

1054
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,090
I will protect you.

1055
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,890
I'm not worth protecting...

1056
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,350

Ayanami, why do you pilot your Eva?

1063
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,800
Because of my bond.

1064
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,010
Your bond?

1065
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:38,510
Yes. My bond.

1066
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,640

1067
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,890
With everyone.

1068
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,520
You're strong, Ayanami.

1069
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,480
I don't have anything else.

1070
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:55,610
It's time. Let's go.

1071
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,160

Don't say things like, "I have nothing else".

1213
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:54,850
Don't say sad things like "farewell," as if we'll never meet again...

1214
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,030
Why are you crying?

1215
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,370
I'm sorry.

1216
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:14,330
I don't know what kind of expression I should have at a time like this...

1217
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,710
It'd be best if you smiled, I think.

1218
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:02,050
Let me guess-- The boy has awakened. Now we enter the general phase of the plan, yes?

1219
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,760
That's correct. The Dead Sea Scroll Apocrypha have been fulfilled up to the Books of law.

1220
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,550
The promised time draws near.

1221
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,690
Not the Third again...

1222
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,520
You never change, do you?

1223
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:23,610
I look foward to meeting you, Shinji Ikari.

1224
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:37,120
It's only love

1225
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:41,210
It's only love

1226
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:51,470
If I can be granted just one wish

1227
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:59,810
Let me sleep by your side, wherever that may be

1228
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:02,860
Beautiful world

1229
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:08,110
Unwavering, my eyes are only on you

1230
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:11,030
Beautiful boy

1231
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:19,040
You still don't know how beautiful you are

1232
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,500
It's only love

1233
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:30,630
Whether sleeping or awake

1234
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:40,600
All you dream of is teenage comics, don't you like yourself?

1235
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:47,440
You don't know what you want, but you can't stop wanting

1236
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:58,250
Warm tears roll down your cheeks

1237
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,290
I have nothing I want to tell you

1238
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:04,250
I just want to meet you once more

1239
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,420
I can't say what I want to say

1240
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:12,590
Maybe I'm just a coward

1241
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:14,970
But that's all right too

1242
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:23,270
If I can be granted just one wish

1243
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:31,650
Let me sleep by your side, wherever that may be

1244
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:34,660
Beautiful world

1245
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:39,950
Unwavering, my eyes are only on you

1246
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:42,870
Beautiful boy

1247
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:50,170
You still don't know how beautiful you are

1248
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,340
It's only love

1249
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:02,680
No matter what it is, give everything a try

1250
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:13,280
Even if you lose out, it's a valuable experience

1251
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,360
I don't need newspapers

1252
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:18,370
What's important to me isn't printed there

1253
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,580
How have you been lately?

1254
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:26,670
As long as you are well

1255
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,090
I'll be fine

1256
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:38,430
If I can't meet you before my world ends

1257
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:46,770
Let me sleep by your side, wherever that may be

1258
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:49,820
Beautiful world

1259
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:55,070
As these fleeting days pass by

1260
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:58,160
Beautiful boy

1261
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:03,160
I can't help it but feel uneasy

1262
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:11,710
If I can be granted just one wish

1263
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:18,890
Let me sleep by your side

1264
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:40,030
Beautiful world

1265
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:48,080
Beautiful boy

1266
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:56,550
Beautiful world

1267
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:04,810
Beautiful boy

1268
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:13,270
Beautiful world

1269
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,620
Backup Eva 05 is sortied into action.

1270
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,790
Unit 02 and its pilot are moved to the front lines.

1271
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:33,750
Unit 04 mysteriously goes missing.

1272
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:36,510
The disaster that took place when Unit 03 was forcefully activated.

1273
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,260
And finally, Unit 06 and its pilot descend from the moon!

1274
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:46,010
As Shinji Ikari continues to mentally deteriorate, where will our story lead?

1275
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:50,190
Next time in Rebuild of Evangelion 2.0: Division

1276
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:53,980
Get set up for lots more fan service comin’ up next time, too!
