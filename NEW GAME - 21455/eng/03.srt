1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,610
<i>I'm Suzukaze Aoba.</i>

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,970
<i>No rain can get me down.</i>

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,110
<i>No wind can blow me away.</i>

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,610
<i>And obviously, no bed can keep me asleep.</i>

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,810
<i>It's just another day for me, as a 
responsible working member of society.</i>

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,630
I went back to sleep!

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm late!

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,140
I'd forgotten that my mom was out today.

9
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,280
Wait, I'm not a student anymore.

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,260
What happens if I'm late?

11
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,900
Will I get in trouble?

12
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,860
It's great that you're feeling 
more comfortable here, but...

13
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,360
You lack discipline.

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
As punishment, you're going to stay here in your underwear tonight.

15
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,710
M-My underwear?!

16
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,270
What's up?

17
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,020
Yun-san?

18
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,580
Oh, could it be that you're late, too?

19
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,590
What a coincidence.

20
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,410
Y-Yeah, why aren't you worried?

21
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,510
Well, sometimes, stuff happens 
and you end up late.

22
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,970
W-Well, we're technically not late yet.

23
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,940
If we run from the station, 
we might make it on time.

24
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,800
Sorry to disappoint you,

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,010
but with my endurance, 
I can only run for a minute.

26
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,100
So you can go on your own if you want.

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,580
So you've already tried.

28
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,830
Get Your Dream Body
in Just 2 Months!

29
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,580
Aoba-chan, are you good at sports?

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,160
No, I'm really bad.

31
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,250
When I was in school, I was always 
one of the last ones to finish.

32
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,050
People who run slow also usually run funny.

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,730
Do you run funny?

34
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,480
Oh, yes.

35
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,600
Something like that.

36
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,730
We're the same!

37
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,170
I'm super slow and always finished last, too.

38
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,960
People always tell me I run weird, too!

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,060
I see.

40
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,170
Okay!

41
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll run with you!

42
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,820
<i>I wonder if she just didn't 
want me to see her run.</i>

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,430
We're here.

44
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,700
Let's go!

45
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,920
<i>Huh?</i>

46
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,730
Y-Yun-san!

47
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,300
I'm sorry!

48
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,390
I... can't run anymore!

49
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,660
<i>She's slower than me?</i>

50
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,890
You can't give up!

51
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,150
Let's do our best and run until the end!

52
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,740
At this pace, we can make it on time!

53
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,510
Yun-san.

54
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,850
What?

55
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,560
It's rather empty in here today.

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,230
No one's called in sick yet, 
so they might be running a bit late.

57
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,010
Three people late? 
They all need a reality check.

58
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,820
I'll have to be a little strict with them.

59
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,380
Can you really do that?

60
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,010
Of course I can. How rude!

61
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,500
Good morning.

62
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,440
Wow, how nice of you to be 
walking in so leisurely.

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,460
Do you realize you're late?

64
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,610
I-I'm sorry.

65
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,050
Especially you, Aoba!

66
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,240
It hasn't even been a month since you joined!

67
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,010
You're not in school anymore!

68
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,680
Right.

69
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,510
Ko-chan, they got to the 
front of the building.

70
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,710
Aoba-chan tripped and fell,

71
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,800
and we were helping her pick up her stuff,

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,610
so that's why we're late.

73
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,860
You fell? Are you okay?

74
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,440
So that's why your nose is red.

75
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,130
Wh-Why didn't you explain yourselves sooner?

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,700
I made a terrible assumption.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,990
You're always working so hard,

78
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,660
so it's not that I actually 
think you mess around too much.

79
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,170
But I'm still your manager.

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,340
Anyway, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

81
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,010
I'll let it slide for today,

82
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,690
but make sure all three of 
you submit a tardy form.

83
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,610
I tried something new and messed up.

84
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,640
Ko-chan, you should've 
asked what happened first.

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,610
Yeah, I'll be more careful.

86
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,360
— Several Minutes Later —

87
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,240
So what are these?

88
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
They're our tardy forms.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,350
That's not what I meant!

90
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,320
Why did you both put down "overslept" 
as the reason for being late?

91
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,210
I can't let you off the hook with that.

92
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,090
Redo it!

93
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,380
And... Hifumi-chan...

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,890
I spent too much time
eating breakfast.

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,890
What exactly is this?

96
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,850
Breakfast was just so good today, so I...

97
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,900
That's not what I'm saying!

98
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,350
Don't write emoticons on official documents!

99
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,800
Jeez!

100
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,860
Why did I feel bad earlier?

101
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,750
<i>Yagami-san said she'll let us off the hook,</i>

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,130
<i>but it was my fault for staying 
up late in the first place.</i>

103
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,880
<i>I have to keep myself in check.</i>

104
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,200
Let's do it.

105
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,470
<i>Aoba-chan always gives 100%.</i>

106
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,980
Write your
tardy forms
properly!!

107
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,980
No emoticons!!
(Looking at you, Takimoto Hifumi)

108
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,830
I'm done!

109
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,540
It's pretty good for your first time.

110
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,430
However, it's lacking shadow and depth.

111
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,440
If you compare your character with 
Hifumin's, she doesn't stand out as much.

112
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,670
Also, her facial expression looks stiff.

113
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,470
She's also a bit inconsistent.

114
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,870
Think about the balance more.

115
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,250
B-But isn't this just a villager?

116
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,050
People don't look at them that carefully.

117
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,320
Really?

118
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
I always look at NPCs carefully.

119
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,630
Like this.

120
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,220
Work on it some more.

121
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,630
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,370
Why is my character moving so disgustingly?

123
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,690
Isn't it disgustingly awesome?

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,010
I think Kii-chan should move more swiftly.

125
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,090
What?

126
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,530
That's not how she should be.

127
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,700
She lives in a cave, you know?

128
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,530
You just don't understand.

129
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,530
Let's just agree to disagree.

130
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,750
Yun.

131
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,750
Hifumin.

132
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,880
Get these done this week.

133
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,880
Here.

134
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,910
Wait, all of them?

135
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,520
This week?

136
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,350
Get me some more disgustingly awesome stuff.

137
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,970
O-Okay...

138
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,360
Make sure they're disgustingly awesome.

139
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,860
Don't forget that you're 
getting this after me.

140
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,960
No. 164:
Undead Nation Monster
"Golm"

141
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,990
Its body is
composed of minerals
like rocks and clay.

142
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,360
Thanks!!

143
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,360
Comment:
It's a giant made up of three residents
of the Undead Nation

144
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,710
Mozuku.

145
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,290
Even if you beg me, I won't feed you.

146
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,730
Mozuku-chan, it's clear that 
your begging has spoiled you.

147
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,190
Your selfish body speaks for itself.

148
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,820
That's right.

149
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,660
So can you play with my body 
to your heart's content?

150
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,290
If you'd like...

151
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,950
You can play with <i>my</i> body.

152
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,830
I see.

153
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,430
You prefer Mozuku's body over mine.

154
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,260
What a shame.

155
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,530
You can use him anytime,

156
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,010
so whenever you feel down, 
feel free to play with him.

157
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,730
Good night. I'm taking off.

158
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,130
Good night.

159
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,500
It's late, so be careful going home.

160
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,440
Thank you.

161
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,300
Okay!

162
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,510
Yagami-san.

163
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,920
Can you take a look?

164
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
Okay.

165
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,370
Use actual objects as reference.

166
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,120
Like this!

167
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,580
- Make shadows clearer
- Look at the actual objects
Check (reference pictures)!
- Look up images online
for relative size. Realistic/Deformation?

168
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,290
leather shoes women's

169
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,840
You need to think about which part of 
the character you want to highlight.

170
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,310
Hot!

171
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,600
Aoba-chan.

172
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,230
It's late, so you should go home now.

173
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,370
Okay.

174
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,920
It's much better, but it 
still looks a little stiff.

175
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,980
I'll give you the whole day 
today, so do another retake.

176
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,920
Okay.

177
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,170
Another retake...

178
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,200
It's true that compared to Hifumi-senpai's, 
I may still have a long way to go.

179
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,730
Looks like Yagami-san's being pretty strict.

180
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,790
Here.

181
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,810
A candy.

182
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,990
Thank you.

183
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,530
I was confident it would pass this time.

184
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,450
Don't overwork yourself too much.

185
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,950
I like your character, at least.

186
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,570
Th-Thank you!

187
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,880
<i>Okay.</i>

188
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,560
<i>Sorry to bother you while you're working.</i>

189
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,170
<i>Yagami-san keeps telling me that my 
character's expression looks stiff.</i>

190
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,470
<i>How do I make her look cute?</i>

191
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,820
<i>Just feel it out.</i>

192
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,940
<i>I think your character's pretty cute.</i>

193
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,130
<i>What are some things you pay attention 
to when you're making models?</i>

194
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,820
<i>I make them while telling
them, "Be cute. Be cute."</i>

195
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,030
<i>Thank you.</i>

196
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,310
<i>I'll do my best!</i>

197
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,660
<i>Good.</i>

198
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,460
Good night.

199
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,020
See ya, Aoba-chan.

200
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,950
What?

201
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,680
Good night!

202
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,430
<i>Oh, no. I'm not done.</i>

203
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,430
Aoba-chan.

204
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,200
How are you doing?

205
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,530
Toyama-san.

206
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,160
I'm still not...

207
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,540
Can I take a quick look?

208
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,450
It's really well done.

209
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,770
I think it's great for a first model.

210
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,420
Oh, but I'm still not satisfied 
with a lot of parts.

211
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,560
I can't fool Yagami-san, either.

212
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,030
True.

213
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,810
She's a perfectionist.

214
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,560
Don't worry about delays.

215
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,620
It's already late today, so let's go home.

216
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay.

217
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,360
Do you live on your own?

218
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,200
No, I live with my parents.

219
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,410
Then they must be worried with 
you coming home late every night.

220
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,760
Yeah.

221
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,240
I called my mom earlier, and she told me 
that staying up late is bad for my skin.

222
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,710
So she's not that worried 
about your safety...

223
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,160
Is it fun creating an NPC?

224
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,930
It is...

225
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,930
But I never knew it was so difficult.

226
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,940
Before, I just drew on my own, 
and it was done when I was happy,

227
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,060
so it's my first time 
receiving so many critiques.

228
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,860
I see.

229
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,660
That's what it means to make 
something professionally.

230
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,450
To be honest, what you 
turned in this morning...

231
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,950
was actually good enough.

232
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,040
What?

233
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,300
What does that mean?

234
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,940
It was good enough, but it got a retake?

235
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,380
<i>We are now arriving at Nakano. Nakano.</i>

236
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,390
I guess she didn't want you to 
be happy with just "good enough."

237
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,770
She has high hopes for you, you know.

238
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,070
I have to switch trains here, so good night.

239
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,650
Good luck.

240
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,690
Good night.

241
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,890
She has high hopes for me?

242
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,930
Hello.

243
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,940
<i>Hey, Aocchi.</i>

244
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,480
<i>Wait, are you outside?</i>

245
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,600
Yeah.

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm near my house.

247
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,270
I'm just getting home.

248
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,760
<i>Wow, a long day at work?</i>

249
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,960
A super long day.

250
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,380
<i>Oh, my mom told me this,</i>

251
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,060
<i>but staying up late is bad for your skin.</i>

252
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,240
I've already heard that today.

253
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,020
<i>What?</i>

254
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,840
<i>It's the first time I told you today.</i>

255
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,070
<i>Sounds like you're doing well at work.</i>

256
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,420
<i>Is it already done?</i>

257
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,090
<i>When's it coming out?</i>

258
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,960
It's not even close to completion.

259
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,480
<i>So it's still not your busiest time?</i>

260
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,930
<i>Are you getting enough rest?</i>

261
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,860
I'm having a hard time modeling 
a villager right now.

262
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,410
<i>What? You're modeling a villager?</i>

263
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,990
Yeah.

264
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,930
<i>What's cool about </i>Fairies<i> is how much 
detail they put into their mobs.</i>

265
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,620
Yeah.

266
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,450
Yagami-san's really strict about it.

267
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,720
<i>They go into a lot of details 
on the character profiles, too.</i>

268
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,430
<i>Aocchi, do you remember?</i>

269
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,190
<i>The three idiots, Dumb,
Dumber, and Dumbest.</i>

270
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,220
<i>Are there mobs like that in the next game?</i>

271
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,720
You sure love that stuff.

272
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,110
I'm just modeling an adorable villager girl.

273
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,460
<i>Like a florist?</i>

274
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,370
Yeah!

275
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,230
She'd be perfect for a florist.

276
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,800
<i>Then she's a gentle girl with dreams.</i>

277
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,970
Wrong.

278
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,160
She takes care of her parents, 
is responsible, energetic, and...

279
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,390
<i>Oh, please!</i>

280
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,240
<i>That's basically the same thing.</i>

281
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,770
What?

282
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,830
The dreamer type is more up in the clouds,

283
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,290
but the responsible type 
is more tough and sincere.

284
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,130
They're totally different.

285
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,550
Also, her facial expression looks stiff.

286
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,010
<i>Hey, something wrong?</i>

287
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Are you listening?

288
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,580
Hello?

289
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,530
This is Nenecchi.

290
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,760
Can you hear me?

291
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,060
A-Aocchi?

292
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,290
Are you okay?

293
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,900
Hello?

294
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,050
<i>Oh! I'm fine. Sorry.</i>

295
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,680
<i>I have to be up early 
tomorrow, so I need to go.</i>

296
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,070
<i>Thanks, Nenecchi.</i>

297
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,350
Snooze

298
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,350
Stop

299
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,420
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

300
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,330
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

301
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm tired.

302
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,740
Morning.

303
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,900
You're early today.

304
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,870
Good morning.

305
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,160
Hey!

306
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,280
Put on a skirt, please.

307
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,910
Oops.

308
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,620
Yagami-san, you should act more 
like a lady when you sleep.

309
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,850
Like a lady?

310
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,390
I wasn't praising you.

311
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,580
Um, I'm sorry it's been so delayed.

312
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,590
I just finished up the villager model.

313
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,830
Could you take a look?

314
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
H-How is it?

315
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,030
Yeah.

316
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,550
It's good.

317
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,740
It's much better.

318
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,160
Yes!

319
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,750
Well?

320
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,750
Are you satisfied with it?

321
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,170
I'm satisfied with this character,

322
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,970
but if I make another one from scratch, 
I think I can do much better.

323
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,460
Also, I spent too long on it.

324
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,730
True.

325
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,310
This one took more than a week, 
but let's try making one in three days next.

326
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,540
What?

327
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,560
Was I unclear?

328
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,570
Three days.

329
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,500
C-Could I get four days?

330
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,970
Are you serious?

331
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,800
Ultimately, I need you making one a day.

332
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,490
What?

333
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,620
Is this what Hifumi-senpai was talking about 
when she said we'll have to live here?

334
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,870
Well, you can leave when you're done.

335
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,780
No!

336
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,220
I don't want to sleep in my underwear.

337
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,710
Wh-What are you saying?

338
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,720
I'm wearing a skirt now!

339
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,760
I'm talking about when you sleep!

340
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,950
<i>Hello.</i>

341
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,200
Nenecchi?

342
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,770
Sorry for hanging up so abruptly last night.

343
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,420
<i>It's fine.</i>

344
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,750
<i>What's up?</i>

345
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,810
I just wanted to hear your voice.

346
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,040
<i>Wh-What's wrong, Aocchi?</i>

347
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,740
<i>Did you eat something funny?</i>

348
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't tell me you're drunk.</i>

349
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,990
<i>We're still minors, you know?</i>

350
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,750
<i>It's really hard with still so much to learn,</i>

351
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,390
<i>but making a game is so much fun.</i>

352
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,630
Good work getting one villager done.

353
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,400
Thank you.

354
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,170
I didn't know you spend 
time making every villager.

355
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,550
You'll be making way more, too.

356
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,010
You have another a hundred or so to go.

357
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:35,460
What?

358
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,710
Can I really get that done?

359
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,640
Next time: "The First... Paycheck..."

360
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,000
