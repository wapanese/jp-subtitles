<i></i>

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,020
<i>It's spring.</i>

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,030
<i>I've graduated high school,</i>

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,880
<i>and I start my job today.</i>

5
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,060
<i>I'm going to be working...</i>

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,980
<i>...at a game company!</i>

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,480
I'm Suzukaze Aoba.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,110
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,550
I'm Suzukaze Aoba.

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,310
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,310
<i>Today's the day I become an adult.</i>

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,520
All right!

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>Wait, can I really go in?</i>

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,520
Hey!

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,540
Just kidding.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,490
This is a company, so no kids allowed.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,290
I-I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,460
Wait, I'm not a kid!

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,980
I'll be working at Eagle Jump starting today.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,620
I am Suzukaze Aoba.

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,530
It's nice to meet you.

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,700
Oh, you were a new employee?

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,470
I'm sorry about that.

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry as well.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,580
My name is Suzukaze Aoba.

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,520
Have you heard about me?

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,760
Suzukaze...

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,480
Oh, I have.

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,120
We're on the same team.

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,670
I'm Toyama Rin. I'm an AD.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,610
It's nice to meet you.

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,940
<i>I'm speaking with a real professional!</i>

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,000
So... You must be busy being an AD.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,710
I see it quite often on the TV,

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,640
but there are so many intricate tasks,

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,450
and they look so busy.

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,410
Oh, my AD doesn't stand 
for "assistant director."

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm an art director.

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,350
So my job is to manage all the artwork.

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm terribly sorry!

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,060
What?

42
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,190
Don't worry about it.

43
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,810
This is your desk.

44
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,690
Oh, would you like something to drink?

45
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,800
Oh, may I have orange—

46
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,590
<i>No, I'm an adult now.</i>

47
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,920
Coffee. Black please.

48
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,010
I'm so glad she seems nice.

49
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm going to be a professional 
starting today.

50
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,610
I'm tired.

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,280
No more...

52
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,030
Is it a ghost?

53
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,330
Panties?

54
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,870
P-P-P-P-P-P-Panties...

55
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,850
A middle schooler?

56
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,240
Why is a kid here?

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,790
I'm not a child.

58
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,220
Oh, you're up.

59
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,090
Rin, who is this?

60
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,420
She's our new employee.

61
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,000
Suzukaze Aoba-san.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,990
Oh, this is mine, but do you want it?

63
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,650
Thanks.

64
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,490
Cool.

65
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,450
So where is she...

66
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,870
This isn't sweet at all.

67
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,620
Oops, then that's hers. Sorry.

68
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,540
Switch.

69
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,150
You have a mature taste.

70
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,420
You drink coffee black?

71
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,900
I'm an adult.

72
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,720
This is no big deal.

73
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,060
You can't drink it?

74
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,270
So how old are you?

75
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,370
I'm eighteen!

76
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,520
Wow, you're a high school grad?

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,790
That's rare.

78
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,070
But you don't even look like a high schooler.

79
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,420
What about you?

80
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,610
How old are you?

81
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,110
How old do you think?

82
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,860
<i>What do I do?</i>

83
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,070
<i>I can't just say whatever.</i>

84
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,860
Th-That's...

85
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,210
A poster of <i>Fairies Story</i>!

86
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,190
Oh, you know it?

87
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,690
That's the first game I was involved in.

88
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,290
What?

89
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,000
I was totally into it in elementary school.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,760
That's how I found out about this company...

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,310
D-D-Don't tell me... you're thir—

92
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,940
I'm not that old!

93
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,210
I'm twenty-five.

94
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,490
I joined after high school, too.

95
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,900
Don't worry about it.

97
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,400
By the way.

98
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,520
How old do I look?

99
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,840
Twenty-three?

100
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,610
We're the same age!

101
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,410
Good girl.

102
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,970
I-It's such an honor.

103
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,830
I'm meeting with the people who 
made the game I loved as a child.

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,960
I especially loved the character design.

105
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,600
My.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,920
She's Yagami Ko who did the 
character designs for <i>Fairies Story</i>.

107
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,460
You're <i>the</i> Yagami-sensei?

108
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,050
Well that earned me respect easy.

109
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,930
She will be your manager starting today,

110
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,750
so I hope you two get along.

111
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,580
I-I'll do my betht!

112
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,750
Hey, you bit your tongue.

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,720
P-Please forget that happened!

114
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,140
<i>I quickly finished my introduction 
to my team members</i>

115
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,200
<i>and then got to work.</i>

116
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,970
<i>It looks like I'm the only 
new recruit this year.</i>

117
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,340
<i>That's kinda lonely.</i>

118
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,450
<i>No, no.</i>

119
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,350
<i>Don't be negative, Aoba!</i>

120
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,050
<i>Get friendly with the girl next to you.</i>

121
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Hello.

122
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,090
It didn't work.

123
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,440
I think this is a good pose.

124
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,530
<i>What kind of company is this?!</i>

125
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,160
Please Hold Your Card 
Up To The Circle

126
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,490
Open

127
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,660
<i>I wonder if the girl at 
that desk is absent today.</i>

128
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,160
Good morning.

129
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,460
Good morning!

130
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,660
H-Hello!

131
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,410
I'm Suzukaze Aoba. I'm starting today.

132
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,510
Takimoto Hifumi.

133
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,800
Nice to meet you.

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,270
Are you also on the character team?

135
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,520
I-I'm sorry.

136
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,860
<i>What do I do?</i>

137
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,250
<i>I don't think I can make any friends.</i>

138
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,340
What?

139
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,160
Why is there a cat here?

140
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,880
You're so cute.

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,370
Hey, there you are.

142
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,540
You came all the way here?

143
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,050
Are you the new employee, Suzukaze Aoba-kun?

144
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,490
Pardon me for my cat.

145
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,880
Oh, no problem at all.

146
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,060
You're cute.

147
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,770
I'm Hazuki Shizuku, the director 
of the game this team is making.

148
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,110
Okay.

149
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,690
It's nice to meet you.

150
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,090
So who's the cat?

151
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,660
He's Mozuku.

152
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,070
I bring him in sometime.

153
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,330
If I leave him at home all the time,

154
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,200
he gets bored and messes up the house.

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
Hazuki-san, I've been looking for you.

156
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
Oh, Umiko-kun.

157
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
What do you need?

158
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,890
You're very late for the meeting.

159
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,230
Oh, oopsy.

160
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,130
Let's not look so upset.

161
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,550
That's how you get wrinkles.

162
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm sorry!

163
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,860
Let's go now.

164
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,280
Everyone's waiting.

165
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,810
Suzukaze-kun, good luck with work.

166
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,110
Th-Thanks.

167
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,820
<i>Maybe the director's not very important...</i>

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,290
<i>A private message?</i>

169
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,890
<i>I'm sorry about earlier!</i>

170
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,830
<i>I'm not very good at speaking.</i>

171
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,840
<i>I'm also on the character team, so ask 
me anything if you have any questions!</i>

172
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,370
<i>Also, just call me Hifumi.</i>

173
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,880
<i>Hifumi-senpai!</i>

174
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,650
Hey, newbie!

175
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,550
C-Coming!

176
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,070
Have you done any 3D?

177
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,150
I don't know anything besides drawing.

178
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,190
Okay, that's not a problem.

179
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,700
Then do chapter one of this book.

180
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,940
Okay!

181
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,770
Okay, then.

182
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,520
Wait.

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,210
Is that it?

184
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,670
<i>Oh, no.</i>

185
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,630
<i>I don't understand this.</i>

186
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,990
<i>But who do I ask?</i>

187
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,710
From Hifumi

188
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,710
I'm sorry about earlier!
I'm not very good at speaking.
I'm also on the character team,
so ask me anything
if you have any questions!

189
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,230
Excuse me, Hifumi-senpai.

190
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,800
Could I ask you a question?

191
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,310
Um...

192
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,050
Hifumi-senpai?

193
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,120
Huh?

194
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,350
From Ko@IWannaLeaveOnTime

195
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,350
Behind you! Behind you!

196
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,020
Excuse me.

197
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,390
Um!

198
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,650
Um...

199
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,530
What are they doing?

200
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,700
Do you have a question?

201
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,570
What?

202
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,000
Y-Yes...

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,530
But I think I've already figured it out.

204
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,210
I got another private message.

205
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,430
<i>If you have questions for 
Hifumin, send her a message.</i>

206
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,210
Yagami-san.

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,180
Okay.

208
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,250
<i>Sent.</i>

209
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,830
<i>My apologies for distracting you earlier.</i>

210
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,670
<i>I had a question.</i>

211
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,040
<i>It says you can hide all but the 
selected object, in the book,</i>

212
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,280
<i>but I can't find the toolbox for it.</i>

213
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,790
<i>Where could I find it?</i>

214
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,350
<i>You don't need to use that.</i>

215
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,780
<i>Just use the Ctrl+H keyboard shortcut.</i>

216
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,640
<i>That solved the problem.</i>

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,570
<i>Thank you.</i>

218
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,160
<i>I'm very grateful for your help.</i>

219
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,520
<i>No problem.</i>

220
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,330
<i>But no need to be so formal.</i>

221
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,860
<i>Smile! Smile!</i>

222
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,940
<i>What? But I'm new here.</i>

223
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,310
<i>Don't worry!</i>

224
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,710
<i>Everyone here's pretty friendly, 
so don't be so tense.</i>

225
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,600
<i>Then...</i>

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,330
<i>Thank you!</i>

227
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,650
<i>I guess?</i>

228
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,530
<i>Good!</i>

229
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,790
<i>I think...</i>

230
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,240
<i>I think...</i>

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,370
<i>I think I can do it!</i>

232
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,990
I got a message from Aoba.

233
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,400
<i>I'm doing the assignments in the book!</i>

234
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,620
<i>Easy peasy!</i>

235
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,700
She got influenced so fast!

236
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,320
<i>That's good.</i>

237
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,520
<i>Could you come see me at my desk?</i>

238
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,840
<i>I need to teach you a few things, 
like how to use private messaging.</i>

239
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,840
Uh                                      oh...

240
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,950
I-I'm terribly sorry!

241
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,300
Just know your place.

242
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,240
<i>Yun, don't you think you should take 
Suzukaze-san to lunch as her senpai?</i>

243
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>I'm all for lunch, 
but why don't you invite her?</i>

244
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,970
<i>You invite her!</i>

245
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,650
<i>You're such a coward. Aren't you her senpai?</i>

246
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,160
Suzukaze-san, you want to go out for lunch?

247
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,810
I'll come, too!

248
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,390
U-Um, what about Hifumi-senpai?

249
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,120
Hifumi-senpai doesn't 
usually go out to lunch.

250
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,750
You wanna come out today?

251
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,940
Sorry.

252
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,780
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

253
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,920
I hope you'll join us next time.

254
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,210
Aoba-chan.

255
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,300
I-I think I'll go!

256
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,000
Aoba, wanna go out for lunch?

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,830
Where is she?

258
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,310
Wh-What's up with you?

259
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,350
I haven't introduced myself yet.

260
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,680
I'm Ijima Yun on the character team.

261
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,310
She and I joined the same year.

262
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,770
I'm Shinoda Hajime on the motion team.

263
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,980
Nice to...

264
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,570
meet you...

265
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,970
I can't!

266
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,880
It's my first time having a kouhai.

267
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,930
And we've only just met.

268
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,680
Please don't worry. You're my senpai.

269
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,660
Shinoda-senpai.

270
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
"Senpai"?

271
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,690
That gives me goosebumps, 
so just call me Hajime.

272
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,850
Hajime-san, then.

273
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,670
You can just call me Aoba.

274
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,340
Nice to meet you, Aoba... san.

275
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,470
Wait, is that weird?

276
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,690
She was asking me to invite you 
in private messaging earlier.

277
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,450
Hey!

278
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,220
Don't tell her that!

279
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,980
Why not?

280
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,570
You're nervous because she's 
your first kouhai, right?

281
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,700
Isn't she your first kouhai, too?

282
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,560
You were worried about her when she was 
trying to talk to Hifumi-senpai earlier, too.

283
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Don't tell her that, too!

284
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

285
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,590
<i>Everyone seems so nice.</i>

286
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,270
All right!

287
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,930
Let's get this done!

288
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,200
But first, I need to use the restroom.

289
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,030
Bathroom, bathroom... 
When you gotta go, you gotta—

290
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,120
Y-Yagami-san!

291
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,720
Wh-What are you doing?

292
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,080
I went to use the restroom, 
but I didn't have my ID card,

293
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,620
so I couldn't open the office door.

294
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,630
Oh, right.

295
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,380
The bathroom is outside the office.

296
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,110
Without your ID card, 
you can't get into the office,

297
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,550
but we also can't track your time.

298
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,350
What is the management thinking, 
forgetting to give it to you.

299
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,050
Ko-chan, did you already take 
Aoba-chan's ID card picture?

300
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,030
What?

301
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,060
Hey.

302
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,860
I asked you to do it this morning.

303
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,410
I'll do it now!

304
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,380
Stand in front of the wall.

305
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,660
O-Okay!

306
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,210
You know, you can wear 
whatever you want here,

307
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,870
but why are you in your school uniform?

308
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,140
Oh, please.

309
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,440
This isn't a school uniform.

310
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,090
This is a suit.

311
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,170
I'm an adult, after all.

312
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,680
<i>It looks like a uniform.</i>

313
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,180
Then at least learn how 
to wear a suit properly.

314
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,810
<i>She doesn't look good in a suit 
because she looks like a kid.</i>

315
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,240
Well, whatever.

316
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,030
I heard what you were thinking just now!

317
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,650
Well, take two.

318
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,290
I don't have enough light.

319
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,570
Hajime, can I borrow your light?

320
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,530
I don't have any light.

321
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,290
You have that light sword.

322
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,640
Hey, perfect.

323
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,850
Perfect!

324
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,310
Look forward to the finished product.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,100
I see.

326
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,750
You couldn't come back in.

327
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,770
Yeah.

328
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,980
I didn't know what to do, 
and I was about to cry.

329
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,940
You really had it rough.

330
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,230
Want to relax with some snacks?

331
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,700
Wow!

332
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,150
<i>Hifumi-senpai, would you like some snacks?</i>

333
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,020
<i>Yeah!</i>

334
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,930
<i>I brought some cookies today.</i>

335
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,610
Here.

336
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,210
Wow!

337
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,990
Aoba-chan, you're learning 3D, right?

338
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,930
Yeah.

339
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm trying to learn as fast as 
possible, so I can help out.

340
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,970
What's the release date of the 
game we're making right now?

341
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,040
When was it?

342
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,100
It's in six months.

343
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,960
The rumor is, we're going 
to get super busy soon.

344
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,760
What?

345
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,850
Yeah.

346
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,730
You won't be able to go home for a while.

347
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,490
<i>It doesn't sound like a joke 
when you speak like that.</i>

348
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,220
But Yagami-san was already sleeping here.

349
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,830
Is it because she's the leader?

350
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,980
I think it's accurate to say she lives here.

351
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,100
She's incredible.

352
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,920
She does several times more 
work than everyone else.

353
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,530
Though she has some personality problems.

354
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,730
Aoba, thanks for waiting.

355
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,180
Here's your ID card.

356
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,180
Now I really feel like an official employee.

357
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,430
You already were official.

358
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,070
It's fine to take breaks, 
but you guys are still clocked in,

359
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,920
so make sure you get back to work soon.

360
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,940
Okay.

361
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,730
So how far have you gotten, Aoba?

362
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,090
Oh, right.

363
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,710
I'm right here.

364
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,490
That's fast.

365
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll send you some work 
soon, then, so be ready.

366
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,280
You'll learn the small 
things through experience.

367
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,710
Okay.

368
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,990
How's Aoba-chan doing?

369
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,590
I'm glad she seems to be a fast learner.

370
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,600
She might turn out to be reliable.

371
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,050
Artist

372
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,640
Let's work hard!

373
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,180
But first, I need to use the restroom.

374
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,710
B-B-B-Bathroom!

375
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,310
Yagami-san!

376
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,760
Good night.

377
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,790
Yagami-san, you're not staying here tonight?

378
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,230
I wouldn't last if I stayed 
overnight every night.

379
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,880
Rin would get mad at me, too.

380
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,210
Rin-san gets mad, too?

381
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,170
She gets mad a lot sometimes.

382
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,890
Artist

383
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,690
Which one is it?

384
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,770
How was your first day?

385
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,400
Do you have any questions?

386
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,180
Y-Yes.

387
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,660
I...

388
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,390
I forgot to ask you something important.

389
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,340
Sure.

390
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,570
Ask me anything.

391
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,660
What's the title of the 
new video game we're making?

392
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,540
Oh, no one told you?

393
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,530
Oh, right.

394
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,800
We forgot to tell her, too.

395
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,530
We're making the third installment

396
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,680
of <i>Fairies Story</i>.

397
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,750
That's the video game that made me 
want to be a character designer!

398
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,590
I'll do my best!

399
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,550
Thank you for having me!

400
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,540
I'm so tired.

401
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
<i>Fairies Story 3</i>.

402
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,310
Nenecchi

403
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,310
It's Nenecchi.

404
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,890
<i>Aocchi!</i>

405
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,770
<i>Did you hear?</i>

406
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,570
<i></i>Moon Ranger<i>'s getting a movie!</i>

407
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,760
What's that?

408
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,900
I've never heard of it.

409
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,030
<i>It's a popular anime!</i>

410
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,470
<i>I'm so glad I've supported it for so long.</i>

411
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,800
<i>Let's go together when it premiers.</i>

412
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,700
Sure.

413
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,780
I'm tired today, so I'm hanging up.

414
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,670
Good night.

415
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,850
<i>Wait!</i>

416
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,300
What?

417
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,770
<i>Well, I figured you had a 
rough first day at work.</i>

418
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,940
<i>So I didn't want to make you 
talk about work at home.</i>

419
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,060
It wasn't like that.

420
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,780
Get this!

421
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,070
It was incredible at work.

422
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,510
You know Yagami Ko-san?

423
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,340
She did the character 
design for <i>Fairies Story</i>.

424
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,550
I'm going to be working with her!

425
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,290
<i>What?</i>

426
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,890
<i>That's incredible!</i>

427
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,560
I'm gonna work really hard.

428
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,420
I'm gonna work really hard 
and learn how to do my job.

429
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,810
In order to make a new game.

430
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,830
Aocchi, is a video game company really busy?

431
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,170
I don't know, Nenecchi.

432
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,040
But there was someone who slept at work.

433
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,930
Did you run into someone 
sleeping in her underwear?

434
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,010
Just kidding. No adult does that.

435
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,850
Next time: "So This is an Adult Drinking Party..."

436
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

437
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,000
"So This Is an Adult Drinking Party..."
