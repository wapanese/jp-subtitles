1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,890
Tokyo Game Exhibit?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,830
But isn't today Thursday?

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,940
Thursdays and Fridays are business days,

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,740
and they're set aside for 
people in the industry.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,990
I see.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,070
And today is the day...

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,540
that <i>Fairies Story 3</i> footage 
goes out to the press.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,750
Oh, but I saw pictures from a game magazine
that were leaked on the Internet last night.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,090
Censored

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Yeah, I know.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,510
Anyway, you three should go to the show.

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,470
You're not coming, Yagami-san?

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,390
I don't have any time with 
the deadline coming up.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,810
We're pretty busy ourselves, too.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,370
Don't worry, I'll overlook 
delays related to the exhibit.

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,640
It'll be a good experience.

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,360
Looks like Hifumin's already there.

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,770
Go!

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,960
Stop sitting around and go!

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,640
Okay! We're going!

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,160
I want to go to the exhibit, too.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,330
Nenecchi.

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,540
Sakura-san, you're dawdling again?

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,250
Umiko-san, can I go to theâ€”

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,250
No.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,230
We don't have any tickets for part-timers.

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,760
You have to stay here.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,320
What?! No fair!

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,890
I'm too busy to go, too.

30
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,350
So stop complaining.

31
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,980
No!

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,860
W-Well, we'll be going now.

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,710
Have fun!

34
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,980
You let them go?

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,040
Yeah.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,300
It's a busy time for sure,

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,290
but it's a rare chance to see an 
announcement for your game in person.

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,120
I suppose that means you'll have to work 
harder to make up for their absence.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
What?!

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,390
Wow, are all the attendees 
in the gaming industry?

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,970
This is only my second time 
here on a business day,

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,350
and I'm surprised to see so many people.

43
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,270
Hey, come on! Let's go!

44
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,770
You didn't even want to come.

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,990
Let's go.

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,340
No new messages.

47
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,240
Have you gotten in touch 
with Hifumi-senpai yet?

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,640
She hasn't replied.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,510
She's usually really fast.

50
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,560
I wonder where she is...

51
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,190
I can't believe there's a really 
good cosplay on a business day!

52
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,880
Is she a professional cosplayer?

53
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,290
Her outfit's incredible.

54
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,030
What game is it from?

55
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,150
Over here, please.

56
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,320
Thank you!

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,010
I love how you're a little mean, too!

58
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,810
The <i>Fairies 3</i> booth should be around here.

59
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,710
Hey, there it is!

60
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,010
I won't let you lay a finger on Sophia!!

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,810
It's Sophia-chan!

62
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,520
Hey! That's the animation I added!

63
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,410
That's my monster!

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,470
It's <i>Fairies 3</i>.

65
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,310
The characters are so cute.

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,890
I'm so excited.

67
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,170
It's kind of embarrassing that 
so many people are watching.

68
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,610
Yeah.

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,750
Hey, this is from Eagle Jump, right?

70
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,120
I loved their previous game.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,330
This must be why Yagami-san told us to...

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,970
<i>I see.</i>

73
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,720
<i>It's also the first time 
Hajime-san and Yun-san</i>

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,270
<i>have had a game they made 
go out to the public.</i>

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,800
<i>And they've been working on it a 
year longer than me, who just joined.</i>

76
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,510
<i>It's coming out soon.</i>

77
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,840
Hey, welcome back!

78
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,660
How was it?

79
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Um...

80
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,290
How should I say it?

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,810
We'll do our best!

82
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,960
Okay, let's get to work.

83
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,200
Gotta make up for the delay.

84
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,570
They're so transparent.

85
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,640
Good for you, Ko-chan.

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,520
They're back already, 
but Hifumin's still not back.

87
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,860
Wow, you're really good!

88
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,230
I'm okay.

89
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,780
Wow, that was the fastest clear!

90
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,870
Demo Section

91
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,280
Thank you.

92
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,650
Aoba, wake up!

93
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,910
You have work!

94
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,260
But it's cold.

95
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,410
Where's your winter suit?

96
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,220
Is it still at the dry cleaner's?

97
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,850
I forgot about it!

98
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,190
Is this too fancy?

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,280
This is too... childish.

100
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,040
I wear a suit every day, so I don't 
feel comfortable picking an outfit.

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,260
What are you doing?

102
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,370
You're going to be late!

103
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,880
Mom, can you pick?

104
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,780
Good morning.

105
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,660
Whoa!

106
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,160
I didn't recognize you, Aoba.

107
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,350
Morning.

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Did the game exhibit light
a new fire under you?

109
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,480
My suit's out for dry cleaning!

110
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,060
We're printing some original 
design art on a game magazine.

111
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,570
Can I use your Sophia-chan as it is?

112
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,030
What do you mean?

113
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,840
People sometimes redraw their original 
works for art books and strategy guides.

114
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,220
Though I don't really do that myself.

115
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,910
Some people fix a few things, too.

116
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,550
So they sometimes have character model sheets

117
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,740
that didn't exist during development.

118
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,610
D-Doesn't that just make it artwork 
similar to original artwork?

119
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,510
Well... yeah, technically.

120
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,470
If you're going to redraw it for the books,

121
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,940
you don't have to put it 
in the magazine this time.

122
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,320
Um... I...

123
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,530
I put my heart and soul into that 
art, so please put it in as it is.

124
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,250
Okay.

125
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,910
Then it'll be your first publication.

126
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,350
My artwork is going to be in a book.

127
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,070
Good morning.

128
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,600
You look cheerful.

129
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,860
Oh, it's nothing!

130
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,930
My, you're dressed special today.

131
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,440
Do you have an interview, too?

132
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,520
An interview?

133
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
What do you mean?

134
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,770
A game magazine's coming 
in for an interview today.

135
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,380
I just assumed because of how you're dressed.

136
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,900
Oh, yeah...

137
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,820
My suit is still...

138
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,640
Wait, is that why you're 
dressed nicely today?

139
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,130
You look fabulous!

140
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,030
Thank you.

141
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,530
I brought you clothes, too, Ko-chan.

142
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,580
What?

143
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,320
I don't want them.

144
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,750
It's too much of a hassle.

145
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,510
Too much of a hassle?

146
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,380
I spent time picking them out for you!

147
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,490
You wear the same clothes every single day!

148
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,550
How about you dress nicely 
like a lady sometimes?

149
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,090
She's right!

150
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,880
It's incredibly hard to choose an outfit!

151
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,350
Why are you upset about it?

152
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,560
Meeting Room 1

153
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,540
Hurry up.

154
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,560
They'll be here soon.

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,970
Strip!

156
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,400
F-Fine, but I don't want to be seen changing.

157
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,770
Turn... around.

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,100
F-Fine...

159
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,890
<i>Just kidding.</i>

160
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,550
<i>I don't care if Rin sees me change,</i>

161
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,560
<i>but I don't wanna change!</i>

162
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,830
Meeting Room 1

163
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,470
Ow!

164
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,390
What are you doing at the door?

165
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,010
Toyama-san asked me to watch the 
entrance so you wouldn't run away.

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,220
Why are you so reluctant to change?

167
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,570
Well...

168
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,410
I'm uncomfortable looking fancy.

169
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,100
My breasts aren't big, 
and I don't look pretty,

170
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,490
so I look better dressed like a guy.

171
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,680
That's not true at all!

172
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,190
Toyama-san picked out your outfit!

173
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
You'll be fine for sure!

174
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,120
I-I'll trust Rin, then.

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,580
Don't get your hopes up.

176
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,680
Meeting Room 1

177
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,900
I-It's normal.

178
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,910
Wow!

179
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,660
You look so cute, Yagami-san.

180
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,020
Yeah, you're so cute, Ko-chan.

181
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,320
S-Stop lying.

182
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,820
So cute!

183
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,330
So cute!

184
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,230
Stop!

185
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,550
What's this?

186
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,460
Looking cute, Yagami.

187
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,470
Don't schedule an interview when we're 
so busy with the deadline so close.

188
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,360
Interviews are part of your work.

189
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,470
This is for the company and for the game!

190
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,230
Rin, say something to her, too!

191
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,340
You're so cute, Ko-chan.

192
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,820
There was a picture in the interview section 
of a previous game's strategy guide.

193
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,190
There it is!

194
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,950
Normally, you don't look as 
ladylike as you do in this picture,

195
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,490
so I didn't recognize you when we first met.

196
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,420
It's not that you only look good in pictures,

197
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,670
but you're actually cute!

198
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,500
I'll get you back later.

199
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,670
I'll start with your shoot first, Yagami-san.

200
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,330
Okay, please smile for the camera.

201
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,930
Okay, thank you!

202
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,740
I want to get a picture for 
the interview page next,

203
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,710
so can you pretend that you're talking?

204
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,530
There's more?

205
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,280
Like this?

206
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,640
Perfect.

207
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,290
You look cute!

208
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,700
Thank you very much.

209
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,370
You look cute when you're embarrassed.

210
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,760
<i>I'm so glad I made her change!</i>

211
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,480
Yagami-san, I'm done fixing 
the models with errors.

212
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,950
Good job.

213
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,110
Then can you help debug?

214
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,970
Okay.

215
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,330
I have to say, it doesn't feel like 
tomorrow's the development deadline.

216
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,330
It's peaceful.

217
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,710
Or like everyday.

218
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,550
You can thank Rin for 
managing the schedule well.

219
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,690
Our tasks as artists are also 
done earlier than other teams.

220
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,490
Seriously.

221
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,140
It's like the calm before the storm.

222
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,850
Can you not foreshadow anything like that?

223
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,410
Menacing

224
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,020
U-Um... Umiko-san?

225
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,070
Regarding the debugging for 
the scene you asked for...

226
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,780
Did the game freeze?

227
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,780
Bingo.

228
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,690
I'm sorry!

229
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm sorry, I lost my composure.

230
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,240
I think we can fix the bug in time.

231
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,990
Please report it to whoever's in charge.

232
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,090
Okay.

233
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,760
Also, everyone's going to be 
staying the night tonight.

234
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,340
Can you go buy everyone some 
energy drinks and food with this?

235
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,510
Yes, sir!

236
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,390
I don't trust you, so take 
Suzukaze-san with you.

237
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,020
Please trust me!

238
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,610
Drugs

239
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,610
Medicine

240
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,850
I didn't know it was that tough over there.

241
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,940
It's intense.

242
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,340
Everyone looks really edgy.

243
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,770
Did you know, Nenecchi?

244
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,330
When you go on an errand, 
you have to get a business receipt.

245
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,830
What's wrong with a normal receipt?

246
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know.

247
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm sure it's fine.

248
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,290
We'll have a record either way.

249
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,400
You're right.

250
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,160
That does make sense.

251
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,340
Right?

252
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,130
Nutritional Supplement Drinks

253
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,130
Hey, there they are.

254
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,980
Energy drinks, energy drinks.

255
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,650
What should we get?

256
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,620
Wow, look at this one!

257
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,500
Froggy
Department Chief

258
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,500
Froggy President

259
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,500
Froggy
Demon King

260
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,500
Froggy Secretary

261
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,500
Froggy Manager

262
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,170
Froggy Demon King!

263
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,780
Wh-What in the world?!

264
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,100
It's way too expensive!

265
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,480
What?

266
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,790
But it's Umiko-san.

267
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,650
The cheap stuff won't work on her.

268
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,070
Umiko

269
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,070
Quality

270
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,780
What is this cheap stuff?

271
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,070
Is this water?

272
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,400
I bet that's what she'll say.

273
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,530
It's scary that it's probably true.

274
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,450
Right?

275
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,180
It has to be this one!

276
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,960
I guess it makes sense since some 
alcohol cost 1000 yen a glass.

277
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,360
Then let's buy this one for Umiko-san,

278
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,380
and regular ones for everyone else.

279
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,690
We can buy snacks and
drinks with whatever's left,

280
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,220
and we'll have a pajama party!

281
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,690
You're staying the night tonight?

282
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,080
Just for tonight.

283
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,960
It's my last day, too.

284
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,290
Oh, yeah.

285
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,130
I'll miss you.

286
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,280
Wh-What's this?

287
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,680
I figured this is what you run on.

288
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,470
How did you know?

289
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,950
I can't get any energy unless 
I get this exact drink.

290
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,170
Did you seriously think that?

291
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,250
Why do you sound so upset?

292
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,170
See?

293
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,480
I told you so.

294
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,980
You totally agreed with me!

295
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,010
Be quiet.

296
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,890
How did you let this happen, Suzukaze-san?

297
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,020
Also, it wasn't a problem today 
because I was planning to pay for it,

298
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,860
but you have to get a business 
receipt, not a normal receipt.

299
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

300
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,050
Sakura-san?

301
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,740
I-I'm sorry.

302
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,600
Oh, well...

303
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,290
I guess I'll try this.

304
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,870
I've never had this before, 
so I am a bit curious.

305
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,660
Instructions?

306
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
How high-class.

307
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,630
I'm getting a bit nervous.

308
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,810
W-Wow...

309
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,420
I feel wide awake.

310
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,630
Seriously?

311
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,930
Do you want to try?

312
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,460
It tastes bad, like medicine.

313
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,260
That's because you're a child, Nenecchi.

314
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,400
Give it to me.

315
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,830
You're acting more childish than Sakura-san.

316
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,420
Deadline!!

317
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,420
I want ramen.

318
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,680
Deadline Today!!

319
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,680
Full speed ahead!

320
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,120
It's 3 AM, but every light is on.

321
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,330
It's so quiet, even though everyone's here.

322
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,610
Everyone's tired.

323
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,730
You've been working really hard.

324
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,510
Lately, with all the people sleeping over, 
I haven't been able to take my clothes off.

325
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,370
I have no problem with that.

326
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,330
Are you done, then, Yagami-san?

327
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,080
Yeah, they told me not to touch anything.

328
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,550
So it's finally done!

329
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,670
It's been a long time, but it felt so short.

330
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,460
It was definitely short for me.

331
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,250
I only worked on it for like six months.

332
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,490
You certainly settled in here pretty quickly.

333
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,930
D-Did I?

334
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,080
You know...

335
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,720
It took me quite a while
to find my place here.

336
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,090
So I'm a bit envious of you.

337
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,420
Yagami-san...

338
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,580
Aocchi!

339
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,550
What's wrong?

340
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,120
It's after three, but I'm not sleepy at all!

341
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,000
Is it the Froggy power?

342
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,000
That stuff doesn't work that well.

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,670
But we got the Demon King one.

344
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,430
Uh... Say what?

345
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,630
Hey, I'm done with work, so they said 
I can leave with the first train.

346
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,510
When do you plan to leave?

347
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,930
Um...

348
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,190
We should have it all done by morning,

349
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,940
so you can go home once that's confirmed.

350
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,490
There you have it.

351
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,410
Really?

352
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,200
Then, let's go home together.

353
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,780
Also, today's the deadline, so good job.

354
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,540
Yagami-san, please take good care of Aocchi.

355
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,540
Are you her mom?

356
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,750
You're still here. Nene-chan, thank 
you so much for working till so late.

357
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,210
Not at all.

358
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,080
Thank you for having me over for tea a lot.

359
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,950
Of course.

360
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,430
Come join us anytime.

361
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,070
We'll have... snacks... too.

362
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,970
Let's talk about cool toys again.

363
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,810
Yeah, things should be pretty 
calm here after today,

364
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,980
so you should come over to hang out.

365
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,980
Yeah.

366
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,880
I'm sure Mozuku will be waiting, too.

367
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,060
I'm so glad everyone's so nice here, Aocchi.

368
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,730
Yeah!

369
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,790
I'm gonna do my best at school, too.

370
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,890
Yeah.

371
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,410
Let's both do our best.

372
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,030
Thanks for working so hard.

373
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,280
Jeez, stop crying.

374
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,040
This isn't goodbye.

375
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,310
I know.

376
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,860
Everyone, please take good care of Aocchi.

377
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,970
Aoba-chan, she's a keeper.

378
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,330
Nenecchi, stop...

379
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,620
Aocchi, are you sleepy?

380
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,890
Yeah.

381
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,240
I wonder if the fatigue is getting 
to me now that it's all done.

382
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,540
Are you okay?

383
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,480
Yeah.

384
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,020
The demon king lives strong inside me.

385
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,920
You just had a sip.

386
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,530
Aocchi, you can sleep.

387
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,560
I'll wake you up.

388
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,500
Okay, then just a bit.

389
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,310
Sorry.

390
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,760
<i>Aocchi, you sure worked hard.</i>

391
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,950
Where are we?

392
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,250
You said you'd wake me up!

393
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,910
The game's finally done!

394
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,130
I'm so excited!

395
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,980
You're like a little girl who's
excited right before a field trip.

396
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,310
Are you already used to 
this stuff, Yagami-san?

397
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,510
Not at all.

398
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,350
But our schedule was pretty 
good this time around.

399
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

400
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,000
"One of My Dreams Came True!"

401
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,040
Next time: "One of My Dreams Came True!"
