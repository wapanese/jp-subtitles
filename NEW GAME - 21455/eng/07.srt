1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
We have a
check-up next week!!
Don't forget!!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
Preliminary questions for
Takimoto Hifumi     at 14:00 in
Iijima Yun               Meeting
Shinoda Hajime       Room 1

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,560
Sorry to bother you, Suzukaze Aoba-san.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,780
Oh. Yes?

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm from the programming team.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,910
We're getting errors from your NPCs.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
They all seem to be careless mistakes,

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,850
but there are a lot, 
and it's quite troublesome.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,510
I-I'm sorry.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,920
Is this an important NPC?

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
Oh, yes!

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,890
I just finished it.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,150
It's very cute.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,560
Thank you.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,220
But this has errors, too.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,160
That's going to be problematic.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,900
Errors?

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,450
Where?

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,160
Right here.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,140
It tells you the error with details.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,910
You're right.

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,700
These errors show up in the game, as well,

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,570
so could you make sure it's error free?

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,630
I thought it was fine because 
the designs were going through.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,960
No one told you about that?

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,480
Yagami-san didn't tell me anything.

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,280
That wretch.

29
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,800
Small errors can sometimes 
cause large errors.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,230
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,950
Since these are visible errors,

32
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,240
it's my fault for not correcting them.

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,180
I'll fix them right away.

34
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,520
Undoubtedly.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,410
Please fix them immediately.

36
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,050
How typical of artists to only 
pay attention to appearances.

37
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,620
S-So long as you fix them, 
I'll have no problems.

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,610
I compiled the errors into a list,

39
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,820
so please let me know when
you're done fixing them.

40
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,350
Okay.

41
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,290
So I know I've seen you a few times.

42
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,900
May I ask for your name?

43
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm Umiko.

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,120
Is Umiko your last name?

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,290
I-I'm sorry.

46
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm Aha...

47
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,620
Aha-san?

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,260
Aha...n.

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,520
Hey, Ahagon!

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,010
Yagami-san?

51
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,670
Don't call me by my last name.

52
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,300
I tell you every time.

53
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,460
But Ahagon's a perfect name for you.

54
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,660
No, it's not!

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,100
Ow!

56
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,550
Ow.

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,150
Ow.

58
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,450
Ow. Ow. Ow!

59
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,520
Don't shoot people
who aren't wearing goggles!

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,310
Ahagon-san?

61
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,090
That's a rare last name.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,310
You write it like this.

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,340
Ahagon

64
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,550
I'm from Okinawa.

65
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,870
I see.

66
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,900
But, Suzukaze-san,

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,580
please call me Umiko.

68
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,800
Are we clear?

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,910
Y-Yes.

70
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,830
Ko-san, please train the new hires properly.

71
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,670
You're making more work for everybody else.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,650
Now, if you'll excuse me.

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
Don't feel down.

74
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,000
It was partly my fault.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,430
She's much nicer than she acts.

76
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,110
I bet she's feeling down, 
thinking she said too much.

77
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,560
I said too much.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,690
Suzukaze-san looked pretty scared in the end.

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,380
I'm sure she hates me now.

80
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,150
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,820
she looked like a monkey who felt bad.

82
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,740
What am I saying?

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
But if she is a monkey,

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,310
she should be happy if I 
give her toys or snacks.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,300
Though I've never had one as pet.

86
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,120
I see.

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,150
Umiko-san came and gave you a word?

88
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,960
It was my fault.

89
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,700
I didn't notice the errors.

90
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,150
But I'm so glad she didn't shoot me.

91
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,420
Umiko-san doesn't usually shoot people.

92
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,950
Only when you make her mad.

93
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,270
You know, her collection's incredible!

94
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,560
Oh.

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,210
I guess you two are a bit similar.

96
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,390
I suppose Umiko-san might 
be a bit short-tempered.

97
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,980
A little birdy told me,

98
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,220
at last year's check-up, the nurse 
was taking too long with the shot,

99
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,120
so she just tried to put it in herself.

100
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,260
I'm sure it's just a rumor.

101
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,690
Rumors are always exaggerated.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,820
Knowing her, it might not be just a rumor.

103
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,450
I agree with Takimoto-kun.

104
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,120
Hazuki-san!

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,830
That sounds like something 
Umiko-kun would do.

106
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,570
<i>She showed up out of nowhere again.</i>

107
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,660
I wish she'd stop shooting 
people with airsoft guns,

108
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,010
but it's great to have 
reliable staff like her.

109
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,570
I see.

110
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,180
Sorry to bother you, Suzukaze-san.

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,890
Ahagoâ€”

112
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,220
Umiko-san.

113
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,150
Thank you for coming.

114
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,640
Thank you for putting 
in the fixes so quickly.

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,850
They're perfect.

116
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,900
Really?

117
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,910
I'm so glad.

118
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,150
And I think I said too much 
earlier, so I'm sorry.

119
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,630
<i>She really felt bad about it.</i>

120
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,720
This is something I treasure,

121
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,300
but I'd like you to have it.

122
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,210
I can't!

123
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,810
It was my fault to begin with.

124
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,970
I'd feel bad.

125
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,320
No.

126
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,970
Please don't worry.

127
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,470
But...

128
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,730
Here you go.

129
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,840
<i>What? What is this?</i>

130
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,880
Oh, it's an empty shotgun shell.

131
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,010
It's the real deal.

132
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,150
Isn't it amazing?

133
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,400
I got it from an American soldier back home.

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
It doesn't have any monetary value,

135
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,690
but you can still smell the gunpowder,

136
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,530
and it gets your blood pumping.

137
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,080
I digress.

139
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,830
Here you go.

140
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,470
It's for you.

141
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,340
Oh, thank you.

142
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,170
I still have much more to see at my desk,

143
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,290
so feel free to stop by if you're curious.

144
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,960
Okay.

145
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,730
Though unfortunately, 
I don't have any real guns.

146
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,900
It would be a crime if you did.

147
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,570
Thank you so much.

148
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,110
I'll take care of it.

149
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,030
I didn't know you were 
into military stuff, Umiko-san.

150
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,470
I know.

151
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,770
Would you like to play airsoft sometime?

152
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,930
It's really fun.

153
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,650
Oh, no.

154
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm terrible at sports, so I'm sorry.

155
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,260
I suppose you need to be athletic.

156
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,250
Guns aren't light, either.

157
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,750
Yeah, so I'll...

158
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,750
Then how about FPS games?

159
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,260
What are FPS games?

160
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,410
They're shooter games. 
played in first-person view.

161
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,690
Even beginners can play those games.

162
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,480
But don't I need good 
reflexes to play those...

163
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
Not at all.

164
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,530
I think it'll be too hard for me.

165
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,900
Positioning is more important than character 
control, so it's all about experience.

166
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,030
But...

167
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,370
When you discover the fun of killing 
other players, you'll be addicted.

168
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,620
<i>I think she likes me.</i>

169
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,110
But if you don't like PvP,

170
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,080
there's also co-op where you 
cooperate with other players.

171
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,380
When you clear a mission through 
teamwork, it's extremely satisfying.

172
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,490
However, you have to start by watching 
the good players from the back.

173
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,270
<i>Is she going to be done soon?</i>

174
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,290
What's going on?

175
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,360
Are you going to play airsoft, too?

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,420
No, she was just telling me about it.

177
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,810
Yeah, it can be a bit 
difficult for beginners,

178
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,030
but with an experienced player like myself...

179
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,960
Until you get mad and start 
shooting friendlies, too.

180
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,050
In what world would I ever do that?

181
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,020
See?

182
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,490
You get mad so easily.

183
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,700
You're the one who makes me mad!

184
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,900
It's almost time to go home.

185
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll let you experience 
just how fun airsoft is.

186
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,960
Experience?

187
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,210
I'll show you to my secret training field.

188
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,590
Look at this, Aoba.

189
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,390
The view is beautiful.

190
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,190
Wow.

191
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,400
It's getting me excited.

192
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,030
Why are you here, too?

193
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,940
Come on, let me join.

194
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,080
I want to know about your hobby, too.

195
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,410
Well, whatever.

196
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,490
It's not like I have anything to hide.

197
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,000
Welcome to my secret training field.

198
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,400
Wait, Umiko...

199
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,560
I have permission to do this here.

200
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,130
Please don't worry.

201
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,510
I'm all ready!

202
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,960
U-Um...

203
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,010
Please be gentle with me.

204
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,050
Yes.

205
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,890
Open your legs a little more.

206
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,770
Aim carefully and pull the trigger slowly.

207
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,470
Be calm.

208
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,990
And squeeze.

209
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,410
I got it!

210
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,870
Well done, Suzukaze-san.

211
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,070
You have talent.

212
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,090
Wow, this feels great!

213
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,330
With practice, you'll even be able to do this.

214
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,690
Incredible!

215
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,330
I bet even I could do that.

216
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,060
Are you being serious?

217
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,130
Dead serious.

218
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,060
Can I borrow them so I can try?

219
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,810
It wouldn't be exciting 
to just lend them to you.

220
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,050
I have an idea.

221
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,110
Um...

222
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,100
Isn't this dangerous?

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,600
This is how they did it in the West.

224
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,750
We're using soft, colored pellets,

225
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,210
so there's no danger.

226
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,290
I've always wanted to try this.

227
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,330
Are you ready?

228
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,360
Ready.

229
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,590
One...

230
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,220
Two...

231
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,350
Three...

232
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,420
Four...

233
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,090
Five...

234
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,500
Six...

235
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,090
Seven...

236
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,090
Eight...

237
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,090
Nine...

238
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,190
Ten!

239
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,800
I can't hit you if you dodge.

240
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,520
I'll get hit if I don't dodge!

241
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,840
Ahagon! Ahagon! Ahagon!

242
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,330
<i>Are they friends or are they enemies?</i>

243
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,950
Please Deposit
Used Robes
Here

244
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,050
Once you've changed into these robes,

245
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,950
please wait in the lobby.

246
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,820
I didn't know they did company 
check-ups at hospitals.

247
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,080
I've never had barium before.

248
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,650
I'm so excited!

249
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,560
Wait, do we get barium?

250
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,890
That's only for older people.

251
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,250
Darn.

252
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,120
It's better to not do it!

253
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,760
Though I don't speak from experience.

254
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,390
Hey.

255
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,520
Your bra's cute, Aoba-chan.

256
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,480
What brand is it?

257
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,770
I don't know.

258
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,820
I don't pay attention to brands.

259
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,620
Maybe there's a label somewhere.

260
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,070
Is this it?

261
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,440
<i>I don't really feel comfortable 
talking about that stuff.</i>

262
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,330
<i>Wow.</i>

263
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,250
<i>This robe is kinda thin.</i>

264
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,330
<i>It doesn't have pads either, 
so my breasts really show.</i>

265
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,690
Okay, I'm ready.

266
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,340
<i>Oh, they have it easy.</i>

267
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,970
Toyama-san.

268
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,610
Hey, girls.

269
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,470
Wow!

270
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,800
Yagami-san!

271
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,130
Are you okay?

272
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,950
She looked at her own blood during the test,

273
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,460
and she started to feel sick.

274
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,200
N-No.

275
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,490
That's not it.

276
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,910
Be careful.

277
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,030
Th-That... nurse...

278
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,810
Wh-Wh-What did she mean by that?

279
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,580
Takimoto-san.

280
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,500
Y-Yes?

281
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,260
First, I'll take your blood pressure, 
and then take your blood.

282
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,100
Don't worry.

283
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,780
Just calm down.

284
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,530
O-O-Okay.

285
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,750
Let's take some deep breaths.

286
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,010
<i>Hifumi-senpai, that's for giving birth.</i>

287
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,880
S-Suzukaze-san!

288
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,590
Yes?

289
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,190
I'll measure your blood pressure first,

290
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,640
a-a-and then take your blood.

291
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,990
O-Okay.

292
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,600
Your blood pressure rises 
when you're nervous,

293
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,150
s-so let's start with a few deep breaths.

294
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,760
O-Okay.

295
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I-I don't have much experience yet,

296
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,380
but I know the textbook inside and out,

297
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,710
so please feel at ease!

298
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,840
<i>So this is what she meant.</i>

299
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,940
Okay, your blood pressure 
measurement is done.

300
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,570
<i>I bet it's high.</i>

301
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,340
Now, let's take your blood.

302
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,110
L-Let's wait just a bit!

303
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,850
Let's calm down first.

304
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,570
Y-You're right.

305
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,240
Let's take a few deep breaths.

306
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,540
<i>Not her, too...</i>

307
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,330
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,950
One of my patients collapsed earlier.

309
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,040
So I'm a little nervous.

310
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,780
I know.

311
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,250
I think that's my manager.

312
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,210
Is that so?

313
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,050
Please tell her sorry.

314
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,480
She had thin veins, so it took 
me a few tries to get it right.

315
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,420
Oh, but don't worry.

316
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,310
I can see your veins.

317
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,810
I can do this.

318
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Ready?

319
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,620
It's done.

320
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,580
<i>Give me the old nurse!
Give me the old nurse!</i>

321
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,570
I'm going out for a bit.

322
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,320
Can you take care of things while I'm gone?

323
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,390
Oh, yes.

324
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,590
No problem.

325
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,590
<i>Will she be okay?</i>

326
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,640
Your back is open.

327
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,030
That wasn't fair.

328
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,380
It's over.

329
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,440
It didn't hurt that much.

330
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,280
Welcome back.

331
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,650
N-Next up, Anamine? Awane?

332
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,100
That's me.

333
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,410
It's Ahagon Umiko.

334
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,800
W-W-Well, I'll take your blood 
pressure and then your blood.

335
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,390
Let's see.

336
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,060
Wait. How do I do this?

337
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,140
Of course.

338
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,540
Just remember the textbook.

339
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,540
N-Next, I'll take your blood.

340
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,050
Blood Drawing

341
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,720
Are you prepared for this?

342
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,050
Wait a minute.

343
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,340
I don't feel comfortable 
with how you're acting.

344
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,830
Can I really trust you?

345
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,180
Don't worry.

346
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,430
I've memorized the textbook.

347
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,860
Wait.

348
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,340
I've never had a dark-skinned patient 
before, so I can't see the vein.

349
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,250
Goodness, you're so slow.

350
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,200
I'll do it myself!

351
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,820
You definitely can't do that!

352
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,040
<i>It was all true.</i>

353
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,050
I'm so glad nothing bad happened.

354
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,220
So true.

355
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,330
Of course nothing bad happened.

356
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,210
<i>But the true test has yet to come.</i>

357
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,210
I'll measure your waist.

358
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,710
<i>I've been on a diet, and I 
didn't eat all day yesterday.</i>

359
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,420
Next person, please.

360
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,220
Thank you.

361
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,870
That's good.

362
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,230
There's the number.

363
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,250
Wow, your waist is very tight and pretty.

364
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh, really?

365
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,260
Thank you.

366
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,410
Do you do any sports?

367
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,250
Just a little exercise.

368
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,300
Though I don't do anything too much.

369
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,830
Wow, she's right.

370
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,900
Your abs are so pretty.

371
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,730
Hey, that tickles.

372
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,730
Hajime.

373
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,240
C-Can I touch it, too?

374
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,220
Sure.

375
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,070
You win!

376
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,270
Come again?

377
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,330
Wow, your waist is pretty, too.

378
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,280
And nice abs.

379
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,250
Thank you.

380
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,350
I put in the work every day.

381
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
Oh, every day?

382
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,300
So do you go...

383
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

384
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,040
Airsofting.

385
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,050
We get some laborious work 
at the programming team,

386
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,370
so we need to maintain fit and 
healthy bodies to prevail.

387
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,170
You sound so professional and admirable.

388
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,010
Hazuki-san.

389
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,890
Are you okay?

390
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,060
Well.

391
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,860
I took barium.

392
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,060
But I'm not used to it.

393
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,280
Umiko-kun!

394
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,000
Can I sleep on your lap?

395
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,910
Your thighs are so nice and tight.

396
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,290
Want to die?

397
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,160
<i>It's weird.</i>

398
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,290
<i>I feel like a different 
person after meeting you.</i>

399
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,420
<i>This is so relaxing.</i>

400
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,750
<i>I feel the same.</i>

401
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,020
No!

402
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,330
This isn't like that at all.

403
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,460
<i>I was able to be honest with myself.</i>

404
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,520
<i>I'm so grateful.</i>

405
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,740
<i>Thank you.</i>

406
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,150
I feel so rested.

407
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,820
Want to grab something 
to eat on the way back?

408
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,980
I'm starving.

409
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,090
I'm in!

410
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,330
Thank you, Yagami-san!

411
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,190
What?

412
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,670
I didn't say I'm paying.

413
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,080
I'll take something with low calories.

414
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,970
I have a meeting, so I'm heading back.

415
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,050
Unfortunately, I have to go back.

416
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,680
I have to go over this month's schedule.

417
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,270
Schedule, huh?

418
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,110
We're going to be getting part-timers soon.

419
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,270
Part-timers?

420
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,020
For debugging.

421
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,050
We need to ask for some outside help.

422
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,090
With the development deadline coming up,

423
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,280
we're only going to get busier from here.

424
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
So please join me for some 
airsoft while we have the time.

425
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,990
Like I've said before,

426
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,990
I'll totally pass!

427
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,080
<i>Really?</i>

428
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,750
<i>You guys have company check-ups?</i>

429
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,610
<i>Did you get taller?</i>

430
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,200
<i>I haven't really grown.</i>

431
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,860
<i>How are you doing?</i>

432
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,430
I have finals coming up, so I've been busy.

433
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,010
Once I'm done with those, 
I'll be on summer break, though.

434
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,400
Summer break?

435
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,560
I wonder how many days off I get at work.

436
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,170
Is it going to be hard to take days off?

437
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,020
<i>Yeah.</i>

438
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,580
I heard we need to hire some part-timers.

439
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,770
But I should have time on Sundays,

440
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,410
so let's go play again.

441
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,950
Aocchi

442
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,670
Aocchi's working hard.

443
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,890
I wonder what it's like 
to work for a company.

444
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,520
Good work this week.

445
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,330
How was your check-up, Suzukaze-san?

446
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,580
I got all As.

447
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,060
But don't overwork yourself.

448
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,030
I'll be careful.

449
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,010
Next time:

450
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,800
"It's Summer Break!!"

451
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

452
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
"It's Summer Break!!"

453
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,930
Whose voice was that?
