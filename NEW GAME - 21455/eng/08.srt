1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,020
Yay!

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm done with finals!

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,570
It's summer break!

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,790
Oh, hey, Aocchi.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,810
How long's your summer break?

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,690
Let's go play!

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,580
College is awesome!

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,320
I have two months of summer break.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,850
Aren't you jealous?

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,590
Aocchi?

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,850
<i>Apparently, I don't get a break.</i>

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,770
Sorry.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,960
We're getting busy going 
into the final phase,

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,810
so we don't get a break until we're done.

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,930
<i>Then you're gonna be busy working?</i>

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,680
Yeah, but it only makes the game better.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,650
You should buy it when it's out.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,120
Of course I'll buy it.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,020
<i>Sorry!</i>

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,530
<i>My lunch break is almost over!</i>

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,670
<i>See ya!</i>

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,060
I wonder if she's okay.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,970
No experience necessary!
Love your work and gain experience.

24
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,950
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,650
My name is Umiko, and I 
will be your supervisor.

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,810
You'll be starting your 
part-time shifts today, and...

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,540
Wait.

28
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,030
We're missing someone.

29
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,180
Goodness.

30
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,130
Being tardy on the first day is unacceptable.

31
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,960
I'll have to see if I can fire her.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,610
U-Um...

33
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,680
Over there.

34
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,690
I'm fired?

35
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,930
What's your name?

36
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,750
I-I'm Sakura Nene!

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,510
I'm sorry I'm late!

38
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,230
I'll overlook it today, 
so be punctual in the future.

39
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,570
O-Okay.

40
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,890
We make our game on this floor.

41
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,940
We have about three teams working right now.

42
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,940
<i>I can't see Aocchi with all the walls.</i>

43
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,150
Stop jumping!

44
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,370
This is the booth where you'll all be 
playing the game and debugging.

45
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,670
The game you'll be testing is <i>Fairies Story 3</i>.

46
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,910
Wow!

47
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,340
No way!

48
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,240
It's still unannounced,

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,880
so please keep confidential 
information within the company.

50
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,650
<i>I already knew because Aocchi told me.</i>

51
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,640
Something on your mind, Sakura-san?

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
N-No!

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,930
I didn't know anything!

54
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,090
That's the quick rundown.

55
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,900
Anyone have any questions?

56
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,650
Sakura-san, you look a little restless.

57
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,780
Oh, do I?

58
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,780
Could it be...

59
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,790
that you're a spy from another company?

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm just a college student!

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,830
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,020
Well, whatever.

63
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,820
If anyone has any questions, let me know.

64
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,240
I'll be back to check up on you, as well.

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,530
<i>Aocchi's company seems pretty strict.</i>

66
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,990
<i>I'm really worried for her.</i>

67
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,660
I-I'm gonna go use the restroom.

68
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,920
Yeah.

69
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,060
The balance is a bit off here.

70
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,280
I see.

71
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,630
<i>Nenecchi?</i>

72
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,270
<i>Why am I hiding?</i>

73
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,010
<i>What is she doing here?</i>

74
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,340
<i>Is it just a look-alike?</i>

75
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,390
You okay?

76
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,250
<i>She's coming this way!</i>

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,150
These are super rare!

78
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,110
<i>That's definitely Nenecchi.</i>

79
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,660
Y-Yagami-san, did we get a new recruit?

80
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,280
I didn't hear anything.

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,410
Oh, did the part-time debuggers start today?

82
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,860
Yeah.

83
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,920
I think Umiko-chan's in charge of that.

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,710
I see.

85
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,370
<i>Knowing Nenecchi,</i>

86
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,930
<i>she didn't tell me about 
it in order to surprise me.</i>

87
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,710
<i>But why would she work 
here just to surprise me?</i>

88
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,770
What's going on with you?

89
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,430
I've made up my mind!

90
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,470
I-I see!

91
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,140
Understood!

92
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,190
<i>I've found her.</i>

93
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,980
<i>And she hasn't noticed me.</i>

94
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,340
<i>Time to surprise her.</i>

95
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,570
Sakura-san.

96
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,950
What are you doing here?

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
U-Um...

98
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,720
Why are you sneaking around 
the place without permission?

99
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,620
You <i>must</i> be a spy.

100
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,140
Come with me!

101
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,580
<i>I-I'm going to get arrested.</i>

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,670
Why isn't she coming?

103
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,180
Aocchi, help me!

104
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,180
Seriously?!

105
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,930
I see.

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,720
So she was your friend.

107
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,030
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm sorry, as well.

109
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
You always make things complicated.

110
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,540
Why would we have a spy?

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,020
Why wouldn't we?

112
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,120
I joined here as a spy, at first.

113
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,450
What? Seriously?

114
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,240
It was a joke.

115
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,880
Hey, Aocchi.

116
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,950
Oh, sorry.

117
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,500
This is Toyama-san, the game's AD.

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,190
I'm Toyama Rin.

119
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,960
Nice to meet you, Sakura-san.

120
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,730
By AD, I don't mean assistant director.

121
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,140
Yeah, I know.

122
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,850
Art director, right?

123
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,280
A-Anyway, she's Yagami Ko-san, 
a character designer.

124
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,890
Hey, nice to meet you.

125
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,520
Yagami Ko?

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,870
The character designer for the <i>Fairies</i> series?

127
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,140
Nenecchi, stop!

128
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,720
It's the real deal!

129
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,090
Sakura-san.

130
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,170
I-I'm sorry.

131
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,290
Thank goodness I wasn't arrested.

132
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,840
It's nice I get paid to 
play an unannounced game.

133
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,040
This might be a great part-time job.

134
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,610
It froze again.

135
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,890
Jeez, how do I play the game 
when it freezes so much?

136
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,790
It's your job to report that!

137
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,890
Aocchi!

138
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,230
It's almost lunch break.

139
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,770
Want to eat lunch together?

140
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,650
Yay!

141
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,100
Let's go!

142
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,820
Oh, and let me introduce my coworkers.

143
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,780
U-Um...

144
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,460
I'm Sakura Nene.

145
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,160
Nice to meet you.

146
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,880
She was so rowdy earlier, but she's so timid.

147
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,500
Is she your kouhai, Aoba-chan?

148
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,380
See?

149
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,510
I told you that you look more childish.

150
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,110
You're just a bit taller than me!

151
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,840
Yes! That's right!

152
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,140
And that means?

153
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,140
<i>They both look like kids.</i>

154
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,190
Thank you for the meal.

155
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,320
I should've bought dessert.

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,520
Oh, I'll be right back.

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,450
My, my!

158
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,740
What's a spy doing here?

159
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,040
I-I'm not a spy!

160
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,160
Hazuki-san, you, too?

161
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
Hazuki-san?

162
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,150
Yeah.

163
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,440
She's the director of <i>Fairies Story 3</i>.

164
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,670
Th-Then she's the most important person!

165
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,980
If a spy were as cute as you,

166
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,560
I'd tell her every secret.

167
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,810
I know.

168
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,560
I'll take your picture for your ID card.

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,840
Come on, get closer.

170
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,650
You can't use that as your 
identification picture.

171
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,560
You don't need to say that.

172
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,580
<i>No one's acting surprised despite 
our strange interaction.</i>

173
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,410
<i>A-Aocchi's company is so weird!</i>

174
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,790
I'm back.

175
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,000
Ta-da, here you go!

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,960
Wow, those look delicious!

177
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,880
Can I really have some?

178
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,380
We got them as Obon gifts 
from one of our partners.

179
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,970
So we share them with 
everyone in the company.

180
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,850
They're in the fridge, so feel 
free to grab some for yourself.

181
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,610
<i>This company is the best!</i>

182
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,510
<i>Every day, it's the same thing over and over.</i>

183
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,250
<i>Debugging is hard.</i>

184
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,770
Sakura-san, were you slacking off just now?

185
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,980
N-No, not at all.

186
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,420
"Bugs!"
·Character clips through the counter at Gorudo's item shop.
·During a battle on sea, tapping the buttons while using
 fire or light spells caused a hard lock (freeze).
·If you sell the morning star you bought in Oh Village
 in the next town of Giiru, it sells for a higher price.
·When fighting the Bubbleman, the magic barrier seems too strong.
·If you go back to Ien Springs with Mystoria in your party, 
you'll end up in a battle with Mystoria again (this causes a freeze whether you win or lose).
·The ice wand causes the Frost Giant a lot of damage?
·Even when you use holy water in the Kekero Forest, you still encounter enemies.
·Opening the window after entering the back gate at Gyameru Castle causes a hard lock (freeze).

187
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,780
"???"
·The inn in Rupi Village was...
·The "Blade of Darkness" should have been called "Sword of Darkness" in 1... 
(The knight called it "blade")
·Using the Tome of Darkness while Conner-kun is present...
·Blue sapphire? Blue sapphire?
·The phrase that the soldier at Coldol Castle says was similar to Steng in game 2.
·The status of the imperial knights is similar to the 
AGI of the lightly-armored soldiers in game 1, is that OK?
·The name of the place that Bald said he was from was...
·Sophie-chan doesn't die?

188
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,840
U-Um...

189
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,950
Something wrong?

190
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,180
No.

191
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,110
If you notice anything, 
even the tiniest things,

192
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,140
please put them all on your report.

193
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,960
O-Okay.

194
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,840
Can't fight on an empty stomach, or something.

195
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,040
Hey, there's a pudding!

196
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,210
It's the last one.

197
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,730
Lucky me!

198
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,300
I won't let you lay a hand on Sophia!!

199
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,430
The Lost Forest Bandits

200
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,420
I just need to keep her in this 
tight space and swing my sword.

201
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,250
Your Sophia-chan won't die!

202
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,300
Wow!

203
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,450
You found a way to keep Sophia-chan alive!

204
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,140
It doesn't let me get past this scene, though.

205
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,960
Oh, Toyama-san!

206
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,090
Look at this!

207
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,780
This is a bug, so let's report that.

208
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,590
I figured...

209
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,760
More importantly, Aoba-chan.

210
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,960
You're still on the clock, so don't 
be away from your desk too long.

211
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

212
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,510
Sakura-san, I understand you're friends, 
but don't call her over too much.

213
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,990
O-Okay.

214
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,120
Rin-san, do you have a second?

215
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,190
I have a question regarding some backgrounds.

216
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,530
Also, Hazuki-san was looking for you.

217
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,660
Oh, okay.

218
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,890
I'll be right there.

219
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,580
Rin, there's a crisis.

220
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,400
What happened?

221
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,750
My pudding is gone!

222
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,130
Oh, you scared me for a second.

223
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,310
But I put it in the fridge!

224
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,160
Rin...

225
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,210
Ko-chan, you're last.

226
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,140
Toyama-san seems really busy.

227
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,730
Oh, yeah.

228
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,530
We're putting out the beta version tomorrow.

229
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,560
The beta version?

230
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,640
Yeah, a sample to give to our publishers.

231
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,920
They determine if the game's playable 
to the point we promised,

232
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,460
and if the quality is up to par.

233
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,190
Ideally, we want to give it to 
them in a nearly completed state.

234
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,850
I see.

235
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,150
If this doesn't pass, we can't sell the game!

236
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,440
What?

237
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,850
So you better get busy, Aoba!

238
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,310
You're behind on your villagers.

239
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,600
I-I know!

240
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,770
I'll see you later, Nenecchi.

241
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,610
But seriously, whatever 
happened to my pudding?

242
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,330
Ko

243
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,680
I need to apologize!

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,840
Sakura-san.

245
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,380
You're on the clock right now.

246
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,980
Please don't leave your desk too much.

247
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,340
Oh, but I...

248
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,740
No buts.

249
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,280
Okay.

250
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,050
Get back to your desk.

251
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,640
O-Okay.

252
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,280
Rin, I made up for Aoba's delay, 
so can you take a look?

253
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,050
You're a lifesaver.

254
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,070
Thank you.

255
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,750
Oh, did you ever find your pudding?

256
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,160
Not at all.

257
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,220
Someone stole it?

258
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,420
I didn't realize our workplace wasn't safe.

259
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,040
It's not that serious.

260
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,310
Sure it is.

261
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,260
We need to have maximum efficiency, 
even after we release the beta.

262
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,240
We need to resolve this 
to keep our teams united.

263
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,210
What?

264
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,870
What can we even do?

265
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,830
I have a plan.

266
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,770
<i>Good day, everyone.</i>

267
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,630
<i>Yagami Ko's pudding was stolen 
from our fridge today.</i>

268
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,750
<i>If you took it, please come see 
me at my desk. I won't get mad.</i>

269
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,080
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

270
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,120
This only works on grade schoolers.

271
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,940
Oh, do you think so?

272
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,470
Yagami-san, can you check?

273
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,710
Okay.

274
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,590
Oh, I read the email.

275
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,100
Was it a really valuable pudding?

276
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,090
No.

277
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,250
Just a 100 yen one from the convenience store.

278
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,110
You sent an email to the 
employee list just for that?

280
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,340
See?

281
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,470
You turned this into something serious.

282
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,420
<i>Something serious?</i>

283
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,820
That wasn't my intention.

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,870
<i>If I turn myself in right here...</i>

285
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,630
I see.

286
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,030
So you were the thief.

287
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,000
How dare you take my pudding?!

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,690
I-I'm sorry!

289
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,040
I'm sorry, too!

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,680
Since you're friends with such a bad girl,

291
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,320
you must be one, too, Aoba-chan.

292
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,570
<i>Aocchi.</i>

293
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,710
I'll get Aocchi in trouble.

294
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,850
Get Aoba-chan in trouble?

295
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,670
Do you need something?

296
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,690
U-Um...

297
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,530
I...

298
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,740
Never mind!

299
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,750
Why did she run away?

300
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,240
The Next Day

301
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,710
Nenecchi, you look tired.

302
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,750
I'm fine.

303
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,260
Hey.

304
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,090
Oh, hello.

305
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,010
Is it okay if I sit here?

306
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,300
Sure, go ahead.

307
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,020
What's up with those bags?

308
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,020
You both look really sleepy.

309
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,100
We found a bug at midnight, right as we 
were about to burn the beta version.

310
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,880
We were up till morning dealing with that.

311
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,290
Th-That's rough.

312
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,050
But we got it all sorted out,

313
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,600
so I think we'll get a good mark.

314
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,380
That's great to hear.

315
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,420
By the way,

316
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,590
this is for you.

317
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,720
Thank you for making up for my delay.

318
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,060
Wow! Thank you!

319
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,860
Did you figure out who took your pudding?

320
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,390
I still have no idea.

321
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,940
But I don't really care.

322
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,780
Well, I'm sure the thief 
deeply regrets her actions.

323
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,360
Really?

324
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,480
Ko-chan.

325
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,920
Yagami Ko-sama, 
I'm sorry for 
eating your pudding!

326
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,930
Hey! My pudding!

327
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,260
I never thought I'd see it again!

328
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
Well, it's thanks to you, Rin.

329
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,710
You can have it.

330
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,620
Thanks.

331
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,010
That's great.

332
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,490
Isn't it, Nenecchi?

333
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,510
Y-Yeah.

334
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,190
Was my email a good idea?

335
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,360
I guess so.

336
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,530
I still think the thief should 
come apologize in person.

337
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,410
You're harsh, Aoba.

338
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,960
Actually, she quietly came 
to apologize yesterday.

339
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,730
Seriously?

340
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,970
Who was it?

341
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,400
Secret.

342
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,750
What?

343
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,590
My email might've made it 
harder for her to say sorry,

344
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,450
and the pudding is a sign 
that she feels bad about it.

345
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,350
Aoba-chan, don't be too 
hard on the thief, okay?

346
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,380
I see.

347
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,310
I guess the thief was actually 
a pretty sincere person.

348
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,610
You, too, Nene-chan.

349
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,680
Okay.

350
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,370
I'm sure she regrets it deeply.

351
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,040
Nenecchi, you're awfully quiet today.

352
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,570
What? No, I'm not.

353
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,210
Wow, this pudding is good!

354
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,830
I know, right?

355
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,450
I'm getting sleepy now that I've eaten.

356
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,640
Yeah, me, too.

357
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,390
Can I go home early today?

358
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,830
O-Of course not!

359
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,650
Stay the full work day.

360
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,010
Something wrong?

361
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,770
No.

362
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,190
I thought companies were a lot scarier,

363
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,200
but it looks like you have 
a lot of good coworkers.

364
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,160
Right?

365
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,010
Yeah.

366
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,800
Another hard day at work.

367
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,940
H-Hold the door!

368
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,470
Safe.

369
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,630
Good work today, Sakura-san.

370
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,650
Sakura-san.

371
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,900
Y-Yes?

372
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,330
Thank you for staying so late again today.

373
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,670
S-Sure.

374
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,500
Sakura-san.

375
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,550
Y-Yes?

376
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,440
You noted things that didn't seem 
consistent with the previous games

377
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,160
in addition to all the bugs you found,

378
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
and the planning team found it very helpful.

379
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,570
O-Okay...

380
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,970
Have a good evening.

381
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,230
Was she complimenting me?

382
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,280
Aocchi, did you mess anything 
up when you joined?

383
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,260
I sent Yagami-san a message with emojis.

384
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,040
What?

385
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,640
I mean, I messed up, too.

386
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,690
We both need to be more careful.

387
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,510
Next time: "Do We Have To Come Into Work?"

388
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

389
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
"Do We Have To Come Into Work?"
