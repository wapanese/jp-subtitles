1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,520
Well, let's see.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,820
She's a bit too tall compared to other 
characters, so can you make her shorter?

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,720
Oh, you're right!

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,990
It's already late today, though, 
so you can finish up tomorrow.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,980
Okay.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,030
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,210
But, Aoba-chan, compared to 
before, you were much faster.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,190
Not at all.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm still really slow.

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,700
Isn't it a lot of work bringing 
Mozuku-chan to work every day?

11
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,450
Yeah, he is a bit heavy.

12
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,350
Though that helps me gain some muscles.

13
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,370
You may need to go on a bit of diet.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,180
It's been almost a month since you joined.

15
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,020
What do you think?

16
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,630
Are you getting used to the job?

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Not at all.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,220
I still get asked to do a lot of retakes.

19
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,630
But it's really fun!

20
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,470
Wh-What was that picture for?

21
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,250
Your smile was just really good, so I had to.

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,290
You had to?

23
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,320
That's not a good reason.

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,010
What are you working on right now?

25
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh.

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm almost done with the third villager.

27
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,770
Soon, I think.

28
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,730
So you've been fixing that one up?

29
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,860
Yeah...

30
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,770
And the retakes weigh on me a lot,

31
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,870
but I can tell it gets better 
every time I make the changes.

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,320
And when Yagami-san gives me the okay,

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,230
it's the best feeling in the world.

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,880
Oh.

35
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't know if I should be saying this.

36
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,850
What is it?

37
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,440
You can tell me everything.

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,940
I'll keep it off the record.

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,730
I don't think it's good for her 
to sleep in her underwear.

40
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,230
It's unprofessional.

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
I agree.

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,340
But when I see her working,

43
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,940
and the more I work with her, 
I realize she's simply incredible.

44
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,030
So she's my role model and an inspiration.

45
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,660
I see.

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm finally alone.

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,330
Now, then...

48
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,910
I'm free! I'm free!

49
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,150
What are you free from?

50
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,600
R-R-Rin?!

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Why are you here?

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,850
I missed the last train.

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,460
Here, I bought drinks.

54
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,600
Thanks...

55
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,930
You should be more careful.

56
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,400
You're lucky it was me who found you.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,890
But it actually feels liberating.

58
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,620
I'm the only one here anyway, 
so why don't you take off your pants?

59
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,620
Even if it's just you, I couldn't 
possibly take my pants off at work!

60
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,130
That's the spot!

61
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,050
I think you have a lot of 
knots from sleeping here.

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,610
I go home every other day.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,080
I think you should be going home <i>every</i> day!

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,560
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

65
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,710
Sleeping here together feels like 
we have a deadline coming up.

66
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,610
So true.

67
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,110
It's going to get more lively here soon.

68
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,870
It's our job to prevent that, you know?

69
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,240
I know.

70
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,250
I wonder if the game will sell.

71
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,500
Who knows?

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,550
I only care about releasing 
a product I'm proud of.

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,380
You're so strong.

74
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,350
Do you have butterflies in your stomach 
since it's your first project as the AD?

75
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,850
A bit.

76
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,880
Oftentimes I think you 
would've made a better AD.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,690
You make the personality 
of the game after all.

78
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,390
Let me tell you.

79
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,370
It's thanks to your management that 
I get to focus on all my work.

80
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,900
And backgrounds are just as 
important in a video game.

81
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,010
Besides, with my personality, 
no one would follow me.

82
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,890
Why am I being so negative?

83
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,680
You can't show this side of you to anyone.

84
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,400
Anyway, I don't know if it'll sell well,

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,440
but I think it's becoming a good game.

86
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,280
Yeah.

87
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,440
Thanks.

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,090
Well, to be honest,

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,690
if our newbie, Aoba, is enjoying 
herself working on it, we'll be fine.

90
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,610
She wouldn't enjoy working on a boring game.

91
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,580
Yeah, I'm glad Aoba-chan's such a good girl.

92
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,680
But if she wants to be a designer, 
I need her to be much more assertive.

93
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,250
She's still new.

94
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,000
I know.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,630
But if it were me, I'd find 
a character I like and

96
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,140
ask to design it, even if I got turned down.

97
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,660
You're so staunch.

98
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,600
Am I?

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,560
But to be honest, I think she has her 
hands full with her villager project.

100
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,650
Maybe you can let her design something 
easy once she finishes that.

101
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,210
Yeah.

102
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,820
Once she finishes all her villagers, 
I might give her a design project...

103
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,750
Wh-What's wrong?

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,620
My computer froze.

105
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,000
I wanted to get back to work, and I can't.

106
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,210
That's it?

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,130
It's a big deal!

108
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,620
This is why I hate 3D!

109
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,790
Then want to sleep?

110
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,800
No.

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,220
I already had coffee, so I'm gonna design.

112
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,490
Jeez.

113
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,730
Don't overwork yourself.

114
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,510
I'm going to sleep.

115
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,680
Okay, good night.

116
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,680
Alarm

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,010
Enter password

118
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,680
It's already morning?

119
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
She's showing her underwear again.

120
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,610
Ko-chan, you'll catch a cold.

121
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,120
I wonder if it really feels liberating.

122
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,930
Yeah.

123
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,980
It actually feels pretty good.

124
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,570
I saw it.

125
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,950
It's not what you're thinking!

126
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,650
What am I thinking?

127
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,150
L-Let me explain!

128
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,490
You should be more careful.

129
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,690
You're lucky it was me who found you.

130
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,820
Please hold your card
up to the circle

131
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,320
Open

132
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,370
Good morning.

133
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,020
Hide.

134
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,310
It's Aoba-chan.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,340
Jeez. Why do I have to hide?

136
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,250
Let's get some work donezo.

137
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,940
She said "donezo."

138
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,940
I wonder if Yagami-san 
stayed the night again.

139
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,070
Good morning.

140
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,330
Did you sleep here againâ€”

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
I-I'm sorry!

142
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,830
It's not what you're thinking!

143
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,480
It's not what you're thinking, Aoba-chan!

144
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,480
I didn't see anything!

145
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,270
I won't tell anyone.

146
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,440
I won't tell anyone!

147
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,410
No! No! No!

148
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,510
Hifumi-chan.

149
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,020
Salary Statement

150
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,020
Here you go.

151
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,260
Yun-chan, good work this month.

152
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,910
Thank you.

153
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,530
Hajime-chan.

154
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,130
Yes?!

155
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,010
Keep up the good work.

156
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,410
I'll do my best!

157
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,190
Aoba-chan.

158
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,090
Yes?

159
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,090
Here you go.

160
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,410
Um... What is this?

161
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,370
It's your salary statement.

162
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,400
How much? How much? How much?

163
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,500
Take a look at it later.

164
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,970
M-My salary?

165
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
This is your first paycheck, isn't it?

166
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,350
Yeah!

167
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,480
I've never worked part-time either, 
so it's literally my first.

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,760
So when you do direct deposit, 
you just get a statement?

169
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,550
Because when I hear salary, 
I had the idea of saying,

170
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,760
"Ooh! I'm gonna be loaded this month!"

171
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,510
Or "I'm poor," depending on 
the weight of the envelope.

172
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,150
Aoba-chan, are you really eighteen?

173
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,310
B-But... is it really okay for me to take this?

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,350
This is all I've done, 
and I've even received overtime.

175
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,300
You're staying late every night, 
so don't feel so reserved.

176
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,390
That's right.

177
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,660
So you have to work really hard, so you 
can fully contribute to the company soon.

178
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,640
O-Okay!

179
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,330
And once the company realizes your skills,

180
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,520
you'll get a raise!

181
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,210
Hajime-san, did you get a raise?

182
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,680
What gave that away?

183
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,300
Though it wasn't a lot.

184
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,410
You're just gonna spend it all 
on the toys for your desk.

185
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,170
Who cares?

186
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,670
I use them as reference.

187
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,830
Yagami-san uses them a lot, too.

188
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,500
Especially this!

189
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,350
You really like that, don't you?

190
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,380
Even though it's useless.

191
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,770
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,700
Its awesomeness alone makes it valuable.

193
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,260
It's important to work with 
a lot of energy, I suppose.

194
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,680
I even have a Western-style sword.

195
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,480
You have everything.

196
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,570
Aoba-chan, hold it. I dare you.

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,020
Wow, it's thin, but it's really heavy.

198
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,120
Isn't it?

199
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,650
It's a slab of metal.

200
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,850
I'm surprised that you can...

201
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,930
swing this around.

202
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,870
I-I'm so sorry!

203
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,410
N-No problem.

204
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,170
Wow, it was finally useful.

205
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,710
You get a raise once a year,

206
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,680
so maybe you'll get paid more next year.

207
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,600
Do I get evaluated well 
if I produce quality work?

208
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,600
Since you're just starting out, you just 
need to complete the work you're given.

209
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,520
But you also get evaluated

210
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,530
on how much you've contributed to the 
team in addition to your own work.

211
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,990
By the way, the character team gets 
evaluated by your leader, Ko-chan,

212
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,030
Yun

213
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,030
Aoba

214
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,030
Hifumi

215
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,050
Character Team

216
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,120
and myself, the AD.

217
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,120
Leader

218
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,120
Rin

219
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,120
Ko

220
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,480
Contribute?

221
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Sounds complicated.

222
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,550
I suppose.

223
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,040
But for now, just do what 
you think is helpful.

224
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,130
But you know,

225
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,030
you guys have it hard with Yagami-san 
since she's strict about work.

226
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,880
You say it like it doesn't apply to you.

227
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,390
Oh, right.

228
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,800
Yagami-san isn't the leader 
of the motion team.

229
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,890
Wait.

230
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,170
Then why are you in this booth despite 
being part of the motion team?

231
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,150
I want to be with my own team, too.

233
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,860
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,100
We ran out of space at 
the motion team booth.

235
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,620
But it's just one booth over.

236
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,120
By the way, do you already know how 
you're using your first paycheck?

237
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,780
Oh? I don't know.

238
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,840
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

239
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,210
How did everyone here spend theirs?

240
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,760
If you buy a figure that you like,
it'll be even more memorable!

241
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,140
<i>She's back to full energy.</i>

242
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,570
I bought clothes.

243
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,140
I splurged a bit to buy from a good brand.

244
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,140
Clothes are a good choice.

245
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,980
H-Hazuki-san.

246
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,010
I wonder what you all would look good in.

247
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,490
Oh, this tea is good.

248
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,440
Thank you.

249
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,280
Hazuki-san, what did you buy 
with your first paycheck?

250
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,150
Oh, I don't know.

251
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,710
It was so long ago, so I 
don't remember too well.

252
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,250
Oh. Then how old are you?

253
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,900
Crack

254
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,170
Hey, Hajime!

255
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,010
That's a sensitive subject.

256
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,820
What?

257
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,010
I'm curious.

258
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,380
Let's see...

259
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,760
I stopped keeping track of 
my age after twenty, so...

260
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,110
Let's say I'm forever twenty.

261
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,940
You're not at your desk.

262
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,360
I should've known I'd find 
you loitering around.

263
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,800
Why hello, Umiko-kun.

264
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
It's fine to take breaks,

265
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,170
but what happened to the documents 
I asked you to look over?

266
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,900
I'd forgotten.

267
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,410
Let me finish taking my break.

268
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,640
If anyone's curious to 
find out Hazuki-san's age,

269
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,560
I can be of assistance.

270
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,710
Shall we go, Umiko-kun?

271
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,340
Time is of the essence, after all.

272
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,540
Goodness gracious.

273
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,130
Let's go.

274
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,710
See you later.

275
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,740
<i>A mysterious twenty-year-old.</i>

276
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,150
So what were we talking about?

277
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,570
Your first paycheck.

278
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,000
That's right.

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,970
What are you gonna do with it, Aoba-chan?

280
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,870
Hm...

281
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,120
I think I'll save up.

282
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,020
<i>She's so realistic.</i>

283
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,910
How did you use yours, Toyama-san?

284
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,970
Me?

285
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,620
I...

286
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,570
What are you guys all talking about?

287
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,900
I was asking Toyama-san how 
she spent her first paycheck.

288
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,320
Hey, I wanna know, too.

289
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,750
How'd you use it?

290
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,210
You don't remember?

291
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,460
I can't believe you!

292
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,960
Uh, did we do something?

293
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,800
Why are you so mad?

294
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,000
Ow!

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,700
We had a day trip to a hot spring together.

296
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,120
That's right! That's right!

297
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,810
Jeez, you don't have to get 
so mad over just a trip.

298
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,830
Just a trip?

299
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,030
We picked the place and everything together.

300
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,110
Oh, now I sorta remember!

301
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,780
Then do you remember where we went?

302
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,290
Ko-chan!

303
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,100
They're so close.

304
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,160
They joined together, too.

305
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,760
It must be a bit lonely that you're 
the only new hire this year.

306
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,550
Yeah.

307
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,060
But it doesn't bother me too much since 
I feel like we're all the same age.

308
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,620
What are you saying?

309
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,560
We act more immature around you 
so we're more approachable.

310
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,900
That's right.

311
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,010
What? Really?

312
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,150
I didn't know that, either.

313
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,650
Hifumi-senpai, do you have 
someone you joined with?

314
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,910
Yeah, in another team.

315
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,410
That's disappointing that 
you guys got separated.

316
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,770
Not really.

317
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,750
I don't talk much.

318
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,410
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

319
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,010
By the way, how'd you 
spend your first paycheck?

320
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,550
...play...

321
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,890
A cosplay costume.

322
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,480
Seriously?

323
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Do you have pictures?

324
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,480
Not telling.

325
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,040
W-Well, saving up is nice,

326
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,040
but I think doing something 
memorable is good, too.

327
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,330
Though some people will forget it anyway.

328
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,880
But you're right.

329
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,630
I'll think of something.

330
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,600
<i>How I should spend my first paycheck, huh?</i>

331
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,750
All right!

332
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,850
I'm done!

333
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,780
Time to go buy figures!

334
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,230
You're buying more?

335
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,800
You jelly?

336
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,140
I didn't ask out of jealousy.

337
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,240
But maybe I'll buy something 
on my way home, too.

338
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,060
Aoba-chan, you can take off now, too.

339
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,560
You should take the opportunity 
and leave early today.

340
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,680
Thank you, I'll do that.

341
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,250
Shut Down

342
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,760
I wonder what I should do.

343
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,270
Clothes...

344
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:41,520
<i>Oh, yeah. My parents bought me this suit.</i>

345
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,100
<i>It was expensive, too.</i>

346
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,110
All right.

347
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,040
I'm home!

348
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,180
Oh, welcome home.

349
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,500
The bath is ready, so you should get in.

350
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,640
Okay.

351
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,560
<i>I hope they'll like it.</i>

352
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,270
Ta-da!

353
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,700
I got my first paycheck today, 
so I bought a cake!

354
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,970
Rin.

355
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,690
Hey, are you still mad?

356
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,750
No.

357
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,250
I'm not mad at all.

358
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,580
I just completely forgot 
about the hot spring.

360
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,520
I don't care.

361
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,590
Our very first trip together probably 
meant <i>nothing</i> to you anyway.

362
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm just kidding.

363
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,490
I'm sorry, Ko-chan.

364
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,090
I'm really not mad.

365
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,480
I know.

366
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,600
Let's go somewhere nice together right now.

367
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,860
I've always wanted to come to this spa.

368
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,120
What's gotten into you today?

369
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,300
Well, you were saying your stomach 
hurt from the responsibility as an AD.

370
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,630
Oh, it's better to heat 
up your stomach first.

371
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,690
Thanks, Ko-chan.

372
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,640
Wh-What? What is it?

373
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,150
Well, it's just... Rin...

374
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,440
Did you get fat?

375
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, this upper arm feels kinda...

376
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,630
Rin?

377
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,670
Ko-chan!

378
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,580
Aoba-chan, you bought a 
cake for your parents?

379
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,230
Yeah.

380
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,760
My dad was in tears.

381
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,390
Every father's happy when their 
daughter does something nice.

382
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,690
But my mom ate it all while he was crying.

383
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,100
Your parents are interesting.

384
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,930
Next time: "That's How Many 
Nights We Have to Stay Over?"

385
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

386
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,000
"That's How Many Nights We Have To Stay Over?"
