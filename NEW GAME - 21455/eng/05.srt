1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,250
Is that Aoba-chan's model?

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,320
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,780
I'm adding motions to her.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,670
This is the idle motion.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,690
What do you think?

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,100
Let's see.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,910
She's a cute model, so I think 
you should make it more cutesy.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,840
Cutesy?

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,290
Hm...

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,910
But I don't want to overdo it.

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>It's kind of embarrassing hearing 
them talk about a model I made.</i>

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,700
What about this pose?

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,520
It looks calculated.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,970
What's up?

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,410
I think she's curious about her.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,480
Right.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,480
<i>I know...</i>

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,490
So this is the conversation motion?

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,480
This is the walking motion?

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,490
Wow, and this one?

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,980
Please don't tease me!

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,480
Sorry.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,500
I couldn't stop because you react so well.

24
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,420
Excuse me.

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,460
Could I take a quick look?

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,880
Sure, but it's nothing special.

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,680
It is!

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,840
Even from my desk, it looked 
like she was actually alive.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,640
It's been on my mind all week.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,140
Hajime-san, you're incredible.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,140
I-I guess I am.

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,150
But I'm sure you could pick it 
up if you worked hard for it.

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,580
You really think so?

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,770
They're so transparent.

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,770
You gotta work hard though.

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,150
Of course.

37
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,350
Ko-chan, do you have an extra tablet pen?

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,220
No, I don't have any.

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,490
That's not good.

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,660
Mine's not responding well.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,310
We should make Hajime and Aoba go buy one!

42
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,930
Yeah, I'm a genius.

43
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,740
I could just ask the other teams.

44
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,000
Hajime! Aoba!

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,140
Yagami-san.

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,550
What do you need?

47
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,360
<i>She's so easy to read.</i>

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,080
Do they give errands often?

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,820
No.

50
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,230
Only sometimes.

51
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,570
But I'm sure I won't be 
tagging along next time,

52
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,740
so make sure you don't 
throw away any receipts.

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,320
O-Okay.

54
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,700
I'll be careful.

55
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,050
<i>I-It feels so good to be a senpai.</i>

56
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,010
I didn't know tablet pens 
came in so many sizes.

57
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,210
Which one should I get?

58
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>Hm, I don't really know.</i>

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,720
Just get the normal one.

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,220
Then I'll take this one to the register.

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I-I'm sorry.

62
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,270
I forgot my wallet at work.

63
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,230
What?

64
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,390
You're so lax.

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,810
Make sure you don't forget it next time.

66
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,130
Did you forget it, too?

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,120
No.

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,520
I dropped mine.

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,720
It's always in my pocket.

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,130
What?

71
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,190
It looks like it's not in the store.

72
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm gonna go ask the service desk,

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,020
so can you go back to work 
and bring your wallet?

74
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,630
Okay.

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,520
But I'll be sure to keep 
an eye out on my way back.

76
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,280
I'm such an unreliable senpai!

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,560
But Aoba-chan's responsible.

78
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,940
She's also diligent and cute.

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,290
She's also still a teen.

80
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,400
Damn it!

81
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,520
Life isn't fair!

82
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,050
Only 21

83
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,860
<i>Are you okay?</i>

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,470
Are you okay?

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,110
<i>I was enjoying the sunlight and I spaced out.</i>

86
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,320
I know how that feels.

87
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,690
I spaced out and lost my wallet...

88
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,130
Hajime-san, there you are.

89
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,900
Aoba-chan, the service desk 
didn't have my wallet, either.

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,890
What's this?

91
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,460
Hajime's Wallet

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,160
Aoba-chan!

93
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,220
Hajime-san, you're overreacting.

94
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,980
When I went back to work, 
I found it on your desk.

95
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,440
Oh, that's right!

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm sorry I'm such an airhead.

97
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,880
Not at all.

98
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,570
I'm absent-minded, too.

99
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,510
So it kinda makes me feel better.

100
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,470
Oh, no.

101
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,370
I shouldn't agree with you.

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,370
<i>Damn it, she's so cute.</i>

103
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,030
But you're cute, so it's okay.

104
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,980
What?

105
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,250
You're cute, too, Hajime-san.

106
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,000
Am I?

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,700
Am I meow?

108
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,850
W-Wow, you're so cute...

109
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,280
Oh, stop it.

110
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,960
Yagami-san!

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,540
We got the pen.

112
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,520
Hey.

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,610
Thanks.

114
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,990
Here you go!

115
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,450
Okay.

116
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,490
Thanks...

117
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,230
Wh-What's wrong?

118
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,970
Oh, me?

119
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,360
What do you mean?

120
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,540
"Oh, me?"

121
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,190
Hajime, I think you got 
your persona mixed up.

122
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,370
No need to tell me!

123
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,450
Damn it!

124
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,130
Hajime-san!

125
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,200
We Have
Cold Ramen!

126
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,200
Open

127
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,300
It's gotten really hot lately.

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,170
Cold

129
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,070
Boo.

130
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,910
Cold!

131
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,530
Good morning.

132
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,480
Good morning, Aoba-chan.

133
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,850
Is that frozen?

134
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,110
Yeah.

135
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,910
It's the best on hot days.

136
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,520
I didn't know you biked to work.

137
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,560
Do you live nearby?

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,040
Yeah, like five stations.

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,610
What?

140
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,280
I would take the train living that far.

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,120
But we sit all day at work,

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,020
so we gotta get some exercise.

143
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,550
You might outgrow your school uniform, too.

144
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,460
It's a suit!

145
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,140
It's true that I do feel like 
I've gained some weight.

146
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,220
Why don't you get off one station early?

147
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,150
Oh, good idea.

148
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,780
What bike do you recommend?

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,860
What?

150
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,020
I'd need a bike from the station.

151
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,750
Just walk.

152
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,240
Of course...

153
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,400
It's nice and cool at work.

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,580
A little too cold, if you ask me.

155
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,590
In that outfit, I'm not surprised.

156
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,010
I should've brought a sweater.

157
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,910
Good morning.

158
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,520
It's really hot outside.

159
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,240
They said it's going to hit 30 degrees.

160
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,670
Oh, you're still in long sleeves, Yun-san?

161
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,540
Y-Yeah.

162
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,530
I don't feel too hot yet.

163
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,600
<i>Good save.</i>

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,890
<i>I can't tell her that I don't 
want to expose my chubby arms.</i>

165
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,660
Do you think I could lose weight 
just by walking one more station?

166
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,490
Wh-What's up?

167
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,840
You're going on a diet?

168
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,530
Yeah.

169
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,010
I think my arms are getting a bit chubby.

170
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,260
Chubby

171
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,970
Could it be...

172
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,150
<i>Wh-What is it?</i>

173
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,890
<i>Do I look fat?</i>

174
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,840
<i>What do I say?</i>

175
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,370
Are you the type who goes 
on a diet in secret?

176
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,300
I-I don't do anything.

177
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,870
<i>T-Too close for comfort.</i>

178
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,070
More importantly, I think it's way too cold.

179
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,860
There's nothing more important!

180
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,160
Stupid!

181
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>I have to lose weight before they notice.</i>

182
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,990
Are we not allowed to raise the temperature?

183
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,270
Yagami-san was changing it a lot last year.

184
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,420
Let's do it.

185
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,860
<i>Would raising it by two degrees be enough?</i>

186
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,300
<i>I doubt people would notice four.</i>

187
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,150
Hot

188
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,150
<i>It's hot.</i>

189
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,490
<i>Is the AC broken?</i>

190
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,990
<i>Now it's colder than before.</i>

191
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,280
<i>Is the AC broken?</i>

192
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,710
<i>It went down by six degrees?</i>

193
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,090
<i>I don't know who it was, but bring it on.</i>

194
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,510
<i>I'll raise it by eight!</i>

195
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,370
<i>My goodness.</i>

196
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,070
<i>It's really hot.</i>

197
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,670
<i>What did Hajime set it to?</i>

198
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,740
<i>I feel disgusting from the sweat,</i>

199
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,570
<i>but I can't roll up my sleeves.</i>

200
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,300
<i>If I sweat here, I can lose weight!</i>

201
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,820
<i>I can kill two birds with one stone!</i>

202
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,780
<i>Don't give in here, Yun!</i>

203
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,320
<i>Yun-san looks busy.</i>

204
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,250
Do it -in-4-days!!-
in 3 days please ♥

205
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,250
<i>I can't slack off.</i>

206
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,540
Do it -in-4-days!!-
in 3 days please ♥

207
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,170
<i>What?!</i>

208
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,720
<i>Who raised it by eight degrees?</i>

209
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,540
<i>I'll get her the next time she comes.</i>

210
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,100
<i>Bring it on!</i>

211
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,420
<i>Oh, no.</i>

212
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,280
<i>It feels perfect.</i>

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,680
<i>I haven't even sweat a full cup.</i>

214
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,930
<i>At this rate...</i>

215
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,460
<i>I'll never be able to wear short sleeves.</i>

216
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,880
Don't be easy on yourself, Yun!

217
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,360
<i>I can't be easy on myself, either.</i>

218
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,310
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

219
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,340
Yun!

220
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,820
Were you raising the 
temperature all this time?

221
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,300
Yagami-san!

222
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,650
I-It wasn't me!

223
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,060
It looked like you set 
it pretty high just now.

224
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,660
It's because I... I...

225
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>I can't tell her I'm trying to 
lose weight by sweating at work.</i>

226
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,450
Wait right there!

227
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,030
Hajime?!

228
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,260
I was the one raising the temperature before.

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,440
I think it's very clear now.

230
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,680
Yun wants the high temperature, too.

231
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,310
Basically, we have the majority on 
setting the temperature to high!

232
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,440
How is it reasonable to decide the 
temperature among the three of us?

233
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,750
Then don't you think it's unreasonable 
that you get to choose?

234
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,280
<i>Don't try to start a fight with her.</i>

235
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,280
What if the computers overheat?

236
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,050
Look, you two.

237
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,000
I was just—

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,030
Hey!

239
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,910
So you three were behind the 
drastic temperature changes?

240
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,710
Toyama-san's mad!

241
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,090
Can't you all just come to a compromise?

242
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,760
B-But my tablet will overheat...

243
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,760
I-I'm cold.

244
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,580
If you can't compromise, I forbid you 
from changing the AC in the future.

245
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,980
O-Okay.

246
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,240
<i>Thank goodness we got that resolved.</i>

247
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,240
We're done here then.

248
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,230
Go back to work.

249
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,730
It's so cool how she deals 
with problems so well.

250
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,160
I admire her.

251
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,770
Really?

252
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,750
We Have
Cold Ramen!

253
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,680
Competitor Aoba looks full of energy!

254
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,260
She used the early riser skill!

255
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,310
Good morning.

256
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,980
Oh, no one's here yet.

257
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,670
Yagami-san...

258
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,910
isn't here.

259
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,160
How rare.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,760
This is her desk.

261
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,660
I am Aoba, a character designer.

262
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,200
Wait! No!

263
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,760
I was just feeling playful, and I...

264
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,170
A-Aoba-chan.

265
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,060
Um...

266
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,650
Good luck.

267
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,080
Th-Thanks...

268
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,110
Yagami-san's desk is always so messy.

269
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,650
I've always been curious.

270
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,930
What are these papers?

271
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,860
I'm not watching.

272
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,870
I won't do it if it's bad!

273
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,050
I think it's okay to just look.

274
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,080
I think so, too!

275
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,840
Wow, these are all character designs.

276
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,490
Bad

277
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,740
They're just minor changes, 
but Yagami-san has a lot of redo.

278
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,270
I see Ko-chan scratching her head a lot.

279
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,080
Really? That's so surprising.

280
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,570
Toyama-san's desk is so neat.

281
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,860
It's an old picture!

282
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,750
If the package of <i>Fairies</i> is on here, then...

283
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,170
It must be the first one.

284
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,450
But Yagami-san looks 
different in this picture.

285
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,880
She used to be really quiet.

286
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,420
What? That's hard to believe!

287
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,970
Winter, 2 Years Ago

288
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,970
We used to sit next to each other,

289
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,480
and she never tried talking to me,

290
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,540
so I liked her, but...

291
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,480
Spring, 3 Months Later

292
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,050
One day, she just...

293
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,040
Takimoto-san, do you have a second?

294
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,770
<i>I see that you haven't changed.</i>

295
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,810
Well, I'm sorry I tried talking to you, too.

296
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,940
But compared to when I first started,

297
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,130
I think you talk with me a lot more now.

298
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:56,600
A-Aoba-chan, it's a bit easier to talk to you.

299
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,500
<i>What?</i>

300
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,820
Gee, thank you.

301
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,250
Aoba-chan, Hifumi-chan, good morning.

302
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,950
You're both early.

303
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,270
Good morning.

304
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,030
How was Ko-chan before?

305
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,610
Yeah, she used to be silent, 
cold, and a bit unapproachable,

306
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,370
but that's what made her so cool.

307
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,010
That's not what I was asking.

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,350
Let's see.

309
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,200
This one time, she got a 
candy from one of her senpais.

310
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,340
You can have one.

311
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,090
Thank you.

312
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,510
It's not very good.

313
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,370
That's way too honest!

314
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,970
Not that she's any different now.

315
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,250
She's always been really good 
and worked really hard, but...

316
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,200
1 every -2-days- 
day!!

317
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,200
She wasn't very good at communicating.

318
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,110
But she can't be a leader like that,

319
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,550
so she's been getting better at it.

320
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,290
It's not exactly the right 
kind of communication,

321
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,810
but it just makes her cuter, don't you think?

322
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,730
<i>It seems that when it comes to Yagami-san,</i>

323
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,290
<i>Toyama-san can't communicate well.</i>

324
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,300
I mean this for everyone when I say this,

325
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,260
but I'm really happy that you're 
able to get along with Ko-chan.

326
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,220
Thank you.

327
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,280
N-Not at all.

328
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,340
It's not like I'm forcing 
myself to get along.

329
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,160
I didn't realize she was being considerate.

330
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,670
I wonder if I should act more 
immature around her from now on.

331
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,080
I think you're just fine the way you are.

332
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,870
And I think Ko-chan is just being herself.

333
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,390
Maybe she's too shy to act too cheerful,

334
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,760
so she hides it by acting like a child.

335
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,570
I see.

336
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,970
After hearing her stories,

337
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,850
I prefer the new Yagami-san over the old one.

338
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,060
That's good to hear.

339
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,450
I—

340
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,980
I... want to...

341
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,950
change, too.

342
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,130
But...

343
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,790
I like you just the way you are!

344
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,130
I'm serious!

345
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,530
Good morning.

346
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,050
Good morning.

347
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,220
That's some bag.

348
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,470
I'm not going home for a while,

349
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,390
so I brought some changes of clothes.

350
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,470
You're not going home for a while?

351
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,040
Well...

352
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,310
I get more work done at night?

353
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,940
<i>So she still prefers to work alone.</i>

354
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,950
I'm cheering for you.

355
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,430
Oh, thanks...

356
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,210
You okay?

357
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,960
Sojiro.

358
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,500
Do you think...

359
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,550
I should change?

360
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,470
Sojiro's Food

361
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,010
Should I do what Aoba-chan said...

362
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,060
and act more childish?

363
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,280
What do you think of a more mature me?

364
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
What do you think?

365
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,730

Next time: "Like... The Release is Canceled?"
