1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,370
<i>The first time I played </i>Fairies Story<i> 
was when I was in grade school.</i>

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,280
<i>I was moved by the story and 
overwhelmed by the game world,</i>

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,740
<i>but I especially grew fond 
of the beautiful characters.</i>

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,310
<i>That's when I found out about 
the character designer job.</i>

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,750
Character Designer:
Yagami Ko

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,650
<i>The character designer of this 
game was called Yagami Ko.</i>

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,190
<i>Yagami Ko.</i>

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,610
<i>To me, that name...</i>

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,330
<i>means something special!</i>

10
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,680
<i>My name is Suzukaze Aoba.</i>

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,770
<i>I joined a game company one week ago.</i>

12
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,410
<i>The name of the company is Eagle Jump.</i>

13
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,180
<i>To my surprise, I was welcomed onto the 
team that's making </i>Fairies Story 3<i>!</i>

14
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,890
Morning.

15
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,560
Oh, good morning.

16
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,090
<i>This lady who was sleeping under 
the desk is Yagami Ko-san.</i>

17
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,820
<i>She's a hard worker, and it looks 
like she stayed the night at work.</i>

18
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
Character Designer:
Yagami Ko

19
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,380
<i>I want to become a character 
designer like her one day.</i>

20
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,580
<i>That's my current goal.</i>

21
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,120
<i>However...</i>

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>I don't plan to sleep in 
my underwear like she does.</i>

23
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,550
Stop staring.

24
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,540
Ko-chan.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Don't be a bad example to other workers.

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,590
Whatever.

27
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,350
Good morning, Aoba-chan.

28
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,390
Good morning to you, too!

29
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,330
<i>She's Toyama Rin-san, an art director.</i>

30
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,060
Where're my pants?

31
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,060
<i>An art director's job is to 
manage all the art related jobs.</i>

32
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Goodness, clean this up.

33
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,650
<i>Rin-san and Yagami-san joined at the 
same time and are close friends.</i>

34
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,420
Can I toss these out?

35
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,150
Oh, thanks.

36
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,650
<i>I'm the only new employee this 
year, so I'm a little bit jealous.</i>

37
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,150
Good morning!

38
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,790
Aoba-chan, look.

39
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,740
I got the new wand from <i>Moon Ranger</i>!

40
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,000
Th-That's incredible.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,750
There are twenty different 
quotes in this thing.

42
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,850
It's so well designed and manufactured.

43
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,970
<i>She's Shinoda Hajime-san with the motion team.</i>

44
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,100
<i>She sits right next to me.</i>

45
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,670
It was super expensive, but totally worth!

46
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,670
<i>She's a super bright and energetic person.</i>

47
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,550
Good morning.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,720
See this? When you swing it...

49
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,240
Ow.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,980
Oh, no!

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,250
I'm sorry, Yun!

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,350
Yun-san!

53
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,160
<i>Iijima Yun-san.</i>

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,900
<i>She's on the character team with me.</i>

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,590
<i>She joined with Hajime-san, and she's a 
responsible, older sister-like person.</i>

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,370
Why're you getting so carried away 
at this time of morning?

57
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,530
I got carried away.

59
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,570
Oh!

60
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,120
I'm getting the urge to swing it around, too.

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,400
Whoa, there.

62
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,420
Good morning.

63
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,860
Oh, good morning!

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,970
<i>She's Takimoto Hifumi-san, 
also on the character team.</i>

65
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,130
<i>She joined before Hajime-san and Yun-san.</i>

66
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,420
<i>She doesn't talk or smile much,</i>

67
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,570
<i>but she's very nice and answers my 
questions through private messaging.</i>

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:02,070
Producer

69
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:02,070
Director

70
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:02,070
Planning             Programmers            Debuggers

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,970
<i>By the way, our team 
structure looks like this.</i>

72
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,070
<i>The director is in charge of everything.</i>

73
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,820
Art Team

74
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,340
<i>The art team consists of background, 
character, effects, and motion teams.</i>

75
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,580
Art Director         Background Team
Leader

76
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,580
Background Team

77
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,580
Character Designer

78
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,580
Character Team
Leader

79
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,580
Character
Team

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,580
I'll do my
best!

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,580
<i>Yagami-san is also the leader 
of the character team.</i>

82
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Effect Team

83
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Motion Team

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,580
A little lonely
on the diagram

85
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,300
Hey, Mozuku-chan...

86
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,280
Stop, I can't work.

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Say, "I'm sorry."

88
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,930
You look experienced.

89
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,210
I'm so sorry!

90
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,770
I'm playing with your cat.

91
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,340
I don't care.

92
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,150
Mozuku's at fault for interrupting your work.

93
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,780
In fact, you could discipline 
me as his owner, too.

94
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,350
I'm kidding.

95
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,600
Come on, don't get in her way, Mozuku.

96
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,140
<i>Hazuki Shizuku-san.</i>

97
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,530
<i>She's the director of </i>Fairies Story 3<i>, but...</i>

98
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,170
<i>Strangely, she doesn't act like one.</i>

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,930
<i>Shizuku-san decided on Mozuku-chan's 
name because it sounded nice.</i>

100
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,430
Tomorrow (4/10)
is Aoba's welcome party!

101
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,430
Don't Overeat or
Drink Too Much!!

102
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,430
Aoba-chan.

103
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,380
What are you doing for lunch?

104
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,350
We're gonna go buy boxed lunches.

105
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm almost done with this part,

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,770
so I'm going to finish up.

107
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,050
I see.

108
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,100
But it's important to eat.

109
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,280
You should at least snack on this.

110
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,920
I shall repay you one day!

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,870
You can buy me lunch sometime.

112
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,170
Are you serious?

113
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm finally done!

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,670
Yun-senpai, thank you so much.

115
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,960
<i>I wonder what Hifumi-senpai does for lunch.</i>

116
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,140
D-Did you need something?

117
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,670
N-No.

118
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,290
I was just wondering what you did for lunch.

119
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,150
I ate at home before coming here.

120
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,520
What? That's amazing.

121
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,580
I don't have time for that.

122
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,490
Though I come a little before lunch...

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,000
I wanted to eat with Sojiro.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,670
S-S-S-Sojiro-san?

125
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,000
Is he your b-b-b-boyfriend?!

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Wanna see his picture?

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,050
Can I really?

128
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,490
<i>She's so fast with her phone.</i>

129
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,220
Here.

130
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,320
A brush?

131
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,350
A hedgehog.

132
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,040
Oh.

133
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,420
You mentioned a boy's name,

134
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,720
so I thought he was your 
boyfriend or something.

135
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,080
My boyfriend?

136
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,850
I can't feel relaxed around men.

137
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,550
Oh! I totally get it!

138
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,280
I get a bit nervous, too.

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,660
I don't really speak from experience.

140
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,750
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,440
I was talking about my fantasy world, too.

142
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,100
I have more.

143
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,200
Wow! He's so cute!

144
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,920
Isn't he?

145
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,380
Are hedgehogs friendly?

146
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,770
Not really.

147
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,890
He's always hiding in his hole.

148
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,140
He's a big coward.

149
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,450
<i>I can see the resemblance.</i>

150
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,160
But...

151
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,530
We've gotten close to where I can touch him.

152
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,210
You're smiling, Hifumi-senpai.

153
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,560
Forget what you saw.

154
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,480
Money?!

155
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,110
No.

156
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,090
Well...

157
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,000
I look so weird.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,230
Not at all!

159
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,120
Your smile is so cute!

160
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,810
You look so kind.

161
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,710
You'd be much more approachable like that.

162
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,990
Do I not look weird?

163
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,600
Not at all!

164
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,350
Then...

165
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,690
No, you were almost there!

166
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,280
I can't.

167
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
Then don't look at me.

168
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Look at Sojiro-kun.

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,860
Smile. Smile.

170
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,790
Smile. Smile.

171
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,620
Lunch, lun—

172
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,750
What are you doing?

173
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,210
Aoba, did you eat lunch?

174
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,100
Oh, I wanted to work on my training.

175
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,220
Taking breaks is part of the job.

176
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,760
Here, have a rice ball!

177
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,200
I feel kind of bad.

178
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,520
Yun-san gave me her snack, too.

179
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,310
I'll take you out to eat sometime, too!

180
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,360
I can't let the newbie take me out!

181
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,860
When you're busy, you should 
buy something before coming in.

182
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,350
Thank you so much.

183
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,030
Thank you for food.

184
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,370
Wow, it's already so late!

185
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,090
I have to eat fast.

186
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,170
<i>Sojiro's...</i>

187
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,410
<i>friend?</i>

188
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,050
Sorry.

189
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,900
N-No worries.

190
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,970
<i>That caught me by surprise.</i>

191
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,460
I'm home.

192
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,790
Sojiro, do you like it when I smile?

193
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,510
Hey.

194
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,920
You brought lunch today?

195
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,510
Yeah.

196
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,970
I got in a fight with Sojiro.

197
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,640
A fight?

198
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,730
I don't think Sojiro likes my smile.

199
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,040
What?

200
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,430
How far are you in the textbook?

201
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,720
Oh, here.

202
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,990
I'm at this part right now.

203
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,530
Cool.

204
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,080
Let's give you a project.

205
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,370
A project?

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,350
Real work.

207
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,250
You're gonna work on your first project.

208
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,390
Okay!

209
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,170
This is Knight-kun, the 
protagonist of <i>Fairies Story 3</i>.

210
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,590
He looks great no matter how much I see it.

211
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,370
Just incredible.

212
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,600
But this town's kind of 
lonely with no one around.

213
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,410
That's right.

214
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,570
Your first job is to make this city lively.

215
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,750
H-How would I do that?

216
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,940
Populate it with people.

217
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,910
I already did the designs,

218
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,950
so you just model them in 3D.

219
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,200
By the way, you call characters 
you don't control "NPCs."

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,180
Or non-player characters.

221
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,540
The characters you can control are "PCs."

222
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,440
All the NPCs in this town are done, 
so you can look at them as reference.

223
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,040
So many cat ears!

224
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,200
So cute!

225
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,730
It's a cat town.

226
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,280
Hifumin did a great job here.

227
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,000
Hifumi-senpai!

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll do my best, too!

229
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,850
What?

230
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,380
You got your first project, Aoba-chan?

231
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,190
Yeah.

232
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,360
I'll do my best.

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,110
Watching you reminds me of 
when I was just starting out.

234
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,110
Though she hasn't messed up as much.

235
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,450
I didn't mess up too much, either.

236
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,610
I just sometimes spilled tea 
or went to the wrong company.

237
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,500
See what I mean?

238
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,000
Be quiet!

239
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,050
It's my second year now, though!

241
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,540
So don't expect me messing up anymore.

242
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,970
Hot!

243
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,720
No!

244
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,390
I'll go grab a towel!

245
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,060
You totally jinxed it.

246
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,900
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,190
Aoba's welcome party is
TODAY!! @ Taiheiyo

248
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,190
Don't Be Late

249
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,010
It's pretty hard.

250
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,950
How did Hifumi-senpai do it?

251
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,130
I see!

252
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,930
So that's how that goes.

253
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,000
Aoba!

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,230
It's almost time for the party.

255
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,880
How do I do this part?

256
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,290
Aoba!

257
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:41,900
Huh?

258
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,220
Oh, yes?

259
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,380
It's time.

260
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,010
Don't make everyone wait.

261
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,960
I-I-I'm sorry!

262
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,350
Well, then.

263
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,350
Let's get started with the welcome 
party for Suzukaze Aoba-chan.

264
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,600
Cheers!

265
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,610
Cheers!

266
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,480
The company's paying for it today!

267
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,690
Let's all eat and drink like crazy!

268
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,110
Okay!

269
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,940
Time to eat!

270
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,190
Hey, don't grab all the meat!

271
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,410
Aoba, eat this to celebrate.

272
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,790
Huh? What is it?

273
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,830
Just eat it.

274
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,390
What was that? It's so spicy.

275
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,020
Spicy takoyaki, Russian roulette style.

276
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,090
You lose!

277
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,850
Aoba-chan, is this your first 
time at a drinking party?

278
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,370
Y-Yes.

279
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,100
After all, you're not of drinking age yet.

280
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,060
What? Is she already drunk?

281
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,860
Yun-san, don't fall asleep.

282
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,860
<i>It looks like Hifumi-senpai
has a high tolerance.</i>

283
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
That's right!

284
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,920
And...

285
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
Hazuki-san!

286
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,710
I figured I'd drop by.

287
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,570
Suzukaze-kun, how is it?

288
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,530
Do you feel welcomed?

289
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,870
Yes, they're treating me well.

290
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,320
I heard.

291
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,290
You were already assigned a project?

292
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,550
Yes, but I haven't made 
much progress with it.

293
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,630
It's still your first day on the project.

294
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,180
Working on a 3D project after just 
one week might be too soon, Yagami.

295
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,490
Well, she was working through the 
textbook pretty fast, so I figured...

296
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,370
Why can't you be more straightforward?

297
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,440
Not
Straightforward

298
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,440
Just say you were genuinely impressed.

299
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,440
Just Praise Her

300
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,990
Suzukaze-kun.

301
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,820
Yagami isn't very straightforward and is 
actually a bit sensitive, so be gentle with her.

302
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,950
I see.

303
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,040
Please just go home already!

304
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,330
This is a party for the character team!

305
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,210
I'm on the motion team...

306
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,120
Don't try to make things complicated!

307
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,490
Our staff can be a little weird,

308
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,990
but I hope you don't get too weirded out.

309
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,870
Not at all.

310
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,710
I was a little apprehensive 
about joining the company,

311
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,140
but I'm relieved that everyone's so nice.

312
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,080
That's good.

313
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,520
Now, then.

314
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,350
I'm going to get going.

315
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,960
You're really going home?

316
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,430
Mozuku will get lonely without me.

317
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,360
I'll walk you out.

318
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,320
By the way!

319
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,870
Thanks for the meat.

320
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,400
She ate mine!

321
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,340
Say, Aoba...

322
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,840
Do you have a boyfriend?

323
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,250
What?

324
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,430
Wh-Why would I have one?

325
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,180
But you look like you have one.

326
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,030
What?

327
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,920
Wh-Why would I have one?

328
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,150
Why are you blushing like a little girl?

329
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,380
I work all the time and 
have no time for love!

330
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,130
Ko-chan, you're drinking too much.

331
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll drink this.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's a stiff drink!

333
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,630
I jon't have a boyfwiend, eijer.

334
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,470
No one asked you!

335
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,840
Aoba-shan!

336
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,390
Newbiesh should be pouwing 
alcohol fer their senpai!

337
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,890
O-Of course.

338
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
I-I'm sorry!

339
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,760
Thash not how ya pour beer for shumone!

340
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,120
Watch and learn!

341
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Ko-chan!

342
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,470
See?

343
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,250
This ish the besht in terms 
of both looks and tashte!

344
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,860
Wow!

345
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,670
No, don't look so inspired.

346
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,070
Are you okay?

347
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,680
She drank too much despite 
being a lightweight.

348
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,380
<i>S-So this is an adult drinking party.</i>

349
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Can you order for me?

350
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,410
S-Sure.

351
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,340
Excuse me!

352
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,940
Coming!

353
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,380
Can I have this... Mori Musashi? Please.

354
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Mori Musashi
(Mori Takezo)

355
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,160
That would be Mori Takezo.

356
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,650
Oh, yes! Mori Takezo.

357
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,890
How would you like it served?

358
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,540
We can serve on the rocks, 
water mix, or soda mix.

359
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,290
Hifumi-senpai, how do you want it?

360
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,230
Just as is.

361
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,680
As is?

362
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,280
As is, please.

363
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,870
Straight, then?

364
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,350
Strai—

365
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,290
It would be straight if I serve it as is.

366
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,690
Yes, straight, please!

367
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,740
Mori Takezo, straight.

368
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,940
I'll bring it right out.

369
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,690
Whew.

370
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,680
Wow, alcohol is expensive.

371
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,740
Some go for 800 yen a glass.

372
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,720
I could buy a manga volume with that.

373
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,000
<i>I-I wonder how it tastes.</i>

374
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,460
Um...

375
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,090
May I have a sip?

376
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,810
What?

377
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,630
J-J-Just a sip...

378
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,010
Yay!

379
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,260
The legal drinking age of 
alcohol in Japan is twenty.

380
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,160
Excuse me!

381
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,770
I-I-I'm sorry!

382
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,480
B-B-But I haven't done anything yet!

383
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,090
We're closing the kitchen soon.

384
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,810
Do you have anything else 
you'd like to order?

385
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,390
What? Already?

386
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,740
It's too soon.

387
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,960
<i>You can drink when you're twenty.</i>

388
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,470
<i>Please stop me sooner.</i>

389
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,080
All right, then.

390
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,120
Who's coming to the after party?

391
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,870
I need to take Yun home.

392
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,250
Huh?

393
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,590
Hifumi-senpai already went home.

394
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,130
I can go.

395
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,010
All right!

396
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,140
Let's go with the three of us!

397
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,050
Bartender, get me whiskey.

398
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,030
You, Aoba?

399
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,980
I'm not trying alcohol anymore, so...

400
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,130
Do they have juice here?

401
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,370
Hey!

402
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,630
I'll have the Orange Blossom!

403
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,870
That's alcohol.

404
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,180
What?

405
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,470
I didn't have any drinks, but I feel drunk.

406
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,350
Hello?

407
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,850
Aocchi!

408
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,060
What's wrong, Nenecchi?

409
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,540
Get this!

410
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,000
Everyone at college treats 
me like a middle schooler!

411
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,550
They're so mean!

412
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,810
But you look and act like a kid, 
so you can't blame them.

413
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,450
You're one to talk, Aocchi!

414
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,130
B-But I'm a working member of 
society and learning adult things.

415
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm growing!

416
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
<i>What'd you learn?</i>

417
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,600
Like...

418
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,510
How to order alcohol.

419
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,780
<i>Oh, no! Call the police!</i>

420
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,470
I didn't have any.

421
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,490
How's work coming along?

422
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,930
<i>I still have a lot to learn, but it's fun.</i>

423
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,980
<i>I'm modeling Yagami-san's 
designs in 3D right now.</i>

424
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,920
Cool.

425
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,480
Is that for <i>Fairies Story 3</i>?

426
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,420
What?!

427
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,280
What?! Are you serious?!

428
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,090
N-No! No!

429
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,020
That silence was just my wishful thinking.

430
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,610
Besides, I can't tell you 
what we're working on.

431
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,950
It's confidential information!

432
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,610
I'm sorry, I'll forget it.

433
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,910
I'll forget what I heard.

434
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,710
I won't let you get arrested!

435
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,150
Arrested?!

436
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,010
You drink alcohol so well, Hifumi-senpai.

437
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,200
D-Do I?

438
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,960
I want to drink hot sake with some broiled 
stingray fin dipped with spicy mayonnaise.

439
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,680
That's what I aspire to become.

440
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,140
Aren't you a minor?

441
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,930
Next time: "What Happens If I'm Late to Work?"

442
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time
"What Happens If I'm Late to Work?"
