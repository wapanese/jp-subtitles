1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,100
I lost again!

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,860
Where do you want to go?

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,160
I want to eat something good.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,160
You're so bad.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,950
One more! One more!

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,390
Hey, isn't this cute?

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,160
Yeah, it's so cute.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,070
<i>Asagaya. Asagaya.</i>

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,810
Excuse me!

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,890
I'm getting off!

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm sleepy, and I don't feel rested.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
It's Saturday, but I have to go in to work,

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,690
so it doesn't even feel like a Saturday.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,370
Which animal do you want to see?

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,840
The giraffe!

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,690
The giraffe?

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,080
Yeah!

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,200
I love giraffes, too.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,810
Really?

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,010
Elephants are cool, too!

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,750
I love elephants, too!

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,130
I feel sad.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,080
I enjoy my work, but it still kinda sucks.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,150
Don't look!

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,340
It'll only make you feel depressed!

26
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,830
Y-Yagami-san!

27
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,590
What was that for?

28
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,570
Sorry.

29
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,560
You looked like you were spacing out.

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,740
You okay?

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,780
I think I'm a bit sleep deprived.

32
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,840
Don't hesitate to tell me when 
you feel super overwhelmed.

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,820
Okay.

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,970
All donuts are half off today!

35
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,590
Donuts Half Off!
Do Do Donuts

36
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,230
Half off!

37
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,590
It's now or never!

38
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,010
I've heard good things 
about that donut place.

39
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,960
Really?

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,210
I bet everyone's in the office, 
so let's buy some for everyone.

41
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,170
Good idea!

42
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,010
I'll go get in line.

43
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,600
She doesn't act sleep deprived.

44
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,560
Do Do Donuts

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,280
Oh.

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,860
Hifumin's the only one here?

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,760
Hifumi-senpai, good morning.

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,850
Good morning.

49
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,170
Wait, what?

50
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,870
Oh, these?

51
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,370
I-I thought... I'd bring 
everyone some sweets.

52
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,570
What do you know... We both got donuts.

53
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,260
Four boxes...

54
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,600
I think we'll just have to give 
some to the other teams, too.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,150
Too bad Nenecchi doesn't 
work on the weekends.

56
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,890
Yeah, part-timers can't work on the weekends.

57
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,150
Why can't part-timers work on the weekends?

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,900
Oh, it depends on the company,

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,080
but they're paid by the hour, so if 
they worked overtime and weekends,

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,320
they'd get paid more than you, Aoba.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,810
W-Wait a minute!

62
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,740
Is being a full-time employee just 
a loophole to make wages lower?

63
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,060
We can talk about that some other time.

64
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,620
I know!

65
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm gonna send Nenecchi a picture of 
these donuts and make her jealous.

66
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,930
You can be kind of a tease.

67
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,130
Well, I'm gonna take a 
box to the design team.

68
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,650
Can you take a box to Ahagon?

69
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,970
Okay.

70
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,740
Oh, I was just laughing because Nenecchi 
is being bitter about the donuts.

71
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,080
A-Aoba-chan...

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,920
Are you the kind of person 
who's... mean to her friends?

73
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,730
What?

74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I-I don't think I... am... probably...

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,300
I only do this to Nenecchi.

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,790
I see...

77
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,290
<i>I want to be friends with her,</i>

78
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:40,310
<i>but if we become too close, 
she might... become mean to me.</i>

79
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,730
Hifumi-senpai, you're twitching again.

80
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,370
You're funny.

81
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,950
Anyway, I'm going to take a box to Umiko-san.

82
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,660
Oh!

83
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,740
I-I'll go... too.

84
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,200
Really?

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,460
Then, let's go together.

86
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,860
Y-Yeah.

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,300
<i>I guess she's not... that mean.</i>

88
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,470
They look so good!

89
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,730
Food bomb

90
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,730
Aocchi, no fair. I hate you~

91
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,950
I want donuts.

92
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,260
Aocchi, no fair!

93
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,270
No fair! No fair! No fair!

94
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,270
Mommy! Hurry up! Come on!

95
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,270
Now, now. No running.

96
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,570
We're going to be late!

97
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,710
Don't worry.

98
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,490
The <i>Signal Three</i> show 
doesn't start until lunch.

99
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,020
I'm going to join the 
<i>Signal Three</i> when I grow up.

100
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,600
And I'm going to protect everyone from evil!

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,650
Is that so?

102
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll protect you, too, Mommy!

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,740
Wow, thank you!

104
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,710
Yay!

105
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,480
Mommy, come on! Hurry!

106
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,680
Today's Saturday.

107
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,090
It's Saturday, but Aocchi has to work.

108
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,850
Excuse me.

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,790
Oh. You couldn't have come at a worse time.

110
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,480
Welcome to the programming team's booth.

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,090
Y-You all look really tired.

112
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,900
Yeah, but I enjoy it.

113
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,350
It's like a war zone.

114
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,090
We've received more bug reports than we 
anticipated, so we have our hands full.

115
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,750
Sakura-san's given us very 
detailed reports, too.

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,600
I see.

117
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,550
So Nenecchi's working hard?

118
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,230
Even the design team thinks highly of her.

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,360
She's noted things only a hardcore fan 
would know and has been very helpful.

120
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,410
She's always loved games,

121
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,110
and the <i>Fairies</i> series 
is one of her favorites.

122
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,940
I see.

123
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,620
Well, I only have a problem 
with Sakura-san's... behavior.

124
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,020
I'll let her know you said that.

125
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,420
Oh, anyway.

126
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,140
We brought something.

127
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,020
It's from Yagami-san, 
Takimoto-san, and myself.

128
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,420
Thank you.

129
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,450
We'll all have some later.

130
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,920
Thank you, Takimoto-san.

131
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,630
I-It's no big...

132
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,230
Huh?

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,950
Let me give you this empty 
shell as a thank you.

134
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,270
You can use it as a pen holder.

135
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,220
Th-Thank you.

136
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,030
I'll take good care of it.

137
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,320
I know.

138
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,360
How about we do some airsoft sometime?

139
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,220
Don't worry.

140
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,920
I'll back you up—

141
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,940
Oh! I just remembered
we have some work to do.

142
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,840
We can talk about this some other time.

143
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,730
Hifumi-senpai, let's go!

144
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,680
They can even be like matryoshka dolls.

145
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,020
They should wake up soon.

146
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,740
Umiko-san's a good person, but she 
can go on and on about her hobby.

147
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,360
So be careful.

148
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,650
I learned that the hard way.

149
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,270
H-Hey.

150
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,000
Thank you... for saving me.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Don't mention it!

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,000
It looked like you were uncomfortable.

153
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,630
<i>I like it when she's nice.</i>

154
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,830
But you look so cute when 
you're uncomfortable,

155
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,530
so I wouldn't have minded 
watching you longer.

156
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,560
Maybe I'll make you more uncomfortable.

157
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,450
Just kidding.

158
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,330
It was just a joke.

159
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,560
<i>It didn't look like... she was joking.</i>

160
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,730
Oh, good morning.

161
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,240
Aoba-chan.

162
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,320
Wait, why do we have more?

163
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,780
They were all half off.

164
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,880
So we got some for all of us.

165
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,880
We all had the same idea.

166
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,460
Good morning.

167
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,800
Thanks for coming in on a Saturday.

168
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,830
These are for everyone.

169
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,570
It's like a donut party.

170
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,440
Actually, I figured you'd get bored 
if you only had sweets, so...

171
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,220
Are those rice crackers?

172
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,020
Yeah.

173
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,030
Sweet, salty, sweet, salty.

174
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:45,410
Sweet

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,720
Sweet, salty, sweet, salty, 
sweet, salty, sweet, salty.

176
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,410
Salty

177
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,410
Sweet

178
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,410
Salty

179
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:45,410
Sweet

180
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,410
Salty

181
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,680
The infinite loop of carbs,

182
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,170
and you can get a spoiled body like Mozuku.

183
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,910
Um... Hazuki-san?

184
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,590
Menacing

185
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,290
I can't!

186
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,590
There's no way I can lay a finger on these.

187
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,780
This is way too much for just us here.

188
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,090
We can take some to other teams.

189
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah.

190
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,430
I'll take some, too.

191
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,340
<i>I don't like it when she's mean.</i>

192
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
I think I'll pass this time.

193
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,250
<i>Don't look at me like that.</i>

194
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,400
Sojiro.

195
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,540
Sojiro, you'll be nice to me, right?

196
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,500
So cute.

197
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,960
Maybe I need to feed her.

198
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,600
You always look so tired.

199
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,830
I'm fine.

200
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,270
How many hours did you sleep last night?

201
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,200
Maybe four hours?

202
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,270
I started drawing after I got 
home, so I went to bed late.

203
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,890
That's not enough!

204
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,300
You went to work last Saturday, too.

205
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,690
You're gonna die.

206
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,010
I sleep a lot on the weekends, so I'm fine.

207
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,390
You've been sleeping over at work, too.

208
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,340
Why do you have to work so hard?

209
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,570
I think your company is weird.

210
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,950
You wouldn't understand, Nenecchi.

211
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,790
<i>I</i> have a dream.

212
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,840
Besides...

213
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,220
Don't you have essays and 
homework during summer break?

214
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,610
You come into work every day.

215
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,450
Don't you have a life?

216
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,100
You dummy!

217
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,300
And Aocchi suddenly got mad at me.

218
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,140
I didn't know she got mad.

219
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,020
I'm surprised.

220
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,450
Sympathize with me!

221
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,510
Aocchi gets mad.

222
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,320
Though it's pretty rare.

223
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,490
For example?

224
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,630
When I was getting bullied, 
she got mad and defended me.

225
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,500
What a touching story.

226
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,770
Look!

227
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,180
Hey!

228
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,640
You boys!

229
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,010
Slowly

230
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,680
Slowly

231
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,350
Slowly

232
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,020
Slowly

233
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,750
Stop!

234
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,690
Slowly

235
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,350
Slowly

236
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,020
Slowly

237
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,690
Slowly

238
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,350
Slowly

239
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,020
Slowly

240
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Huff

241
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,360
D-Don't bully Nenecchi!

242
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,110
A-Aocchi...

243
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,680
But she was so mean today!

244
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,250
Well, I'm sure she got grumpy out of fatigue.

245
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,120
You two will make up fast, I'm sure.

246
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,800
I-It's not like I want to make up with her.

247
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,880
But...

248
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,760
If you finish this job with things like 
this, your friendship might actually end.

249
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,720
I thought you were fine with it.

250
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,360
It's already lunchtime.

251
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm hungry.

252
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,250
<i>Oh, man...</i>

253
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,360
<i>I got so distracted and 
couldn't get any work done.</i>

254
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,370
<i>Why did Nenecchi say that stuff?</i>

255
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,480
Hey, what's everyone doing for lunch?

256
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,160
Sorry, I'm gonna grab a quick bite here.

257
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,150
Same.

258
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,210
Sorry.

259
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,580
Okay.

260
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,510
<i>Hifumi-senpai isn't here.</i>

261
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,310
<i>I wonder if Nenecchi is by 
herself if I don't invite her.</i>

262
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,230
<i>Whatever.</i>

263
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,450
Oh, you're alone?

264
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,290
Yagami-san.

265
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,000
This is rare.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,880
Are you alone, too?

267
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,250
Yeah.

268
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,300
Rin dumped me.

269
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,760
I see.

270
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,130
That was a joke!

271
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,720
What's up?

272
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,690
This morning, Nenecchi and I...

273
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,900
And you two are fighting?

274
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,980
Don't you think she said too much?

275
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,110
I'm just doing my best.

276
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,070
I totally get it.

277
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,110
My momm—

278
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,890
mother also calls me a lot.

279
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,460
And says things like, "You're always working. 
Make sure to take care of yourself."

280
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,960
What a good mother.

281
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,840
Yeah.

282
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,720
I appreciate that she's 
looking out for me, but...

283
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,890
They don't really understand, huh?

284
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,380
You looking at something?

285
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,400
Oh, no.

286
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,110
It's nothing.

287
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,450
I turned around for nothing.

288
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,970
<i>I applied here because I 
was worried about Aocchi.</i>

289
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,460
<i>How did things turn out like this?</i>

290
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,110
You still have ten minutes 
until your lunch break is over.

291
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,110
Ringmaster

292
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,110
In that case, please let Sophia
show you the way.

293
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,470
<i>I can't leave things like this!</i>

294
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,870
<i>I have to make up with her!</i>

295
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,920
Ao...

296
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,750
...cchi...

297
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,190
If you're looking for Aoba-chan,

298
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,450
she went to run an errand for Yagami-san.

299
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,150
I see.

300
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,350
Did Aocchi make all of these?

301
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,040
Oh, yeah.

302
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,520
Like forty or fifty?

303
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,180
You lay them out to make sure 
they all have consistent quality.

304
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,830
But they're all just villagers 
except Sophia-chan.

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,050
She joined pretty late,

306
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,550
so all the important characters 
were already done.

307
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,040
But Aoba-chan's doing a really good job,

308
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,800
so I think she'll get to work 
on better characters next time.

309
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,690
Nene-chan?

310
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,190
<i>She's not assigned good 
jobs unless she works hard.</i>

311
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm gonna work really hard.

312
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,910
I'm gonna work really hard 
and learn how to do my job.

313
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,900
In order to make a new game.

314
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,500
<i>Aocchi!</i>

315
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,670
Nenecchi!

316
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,060
A-Are you okay?

317
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,020
Th-Thanks.

318
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,270
Um!

319
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,040
Wh-What's up?

320
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,640
You're working so hard with your 
work, but I made fun of you.

321
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,350
Oh, no.

323
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,600
I'm sorry, too.

324
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,600
You were just worried about 
me, but I got really mad.

325
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,280
B-But that doesn't mean it's 
okay to overwork yourself.

326
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,980
I know.

327
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll watch out for my health.

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,040
And I'm really happy that 
you're looking out for me.

329
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,080
Th-Then it's fine.

330
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,680
O-One more thing!

331
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,810
I'm looking forward to 
the finished game, and...

332
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,680
I also support you 100%.

333
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,020
So when your dream to be a 
character designer comes true,

334
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,990
and you release your first game,

335
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,370
you have to give me your first autograph.

336
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,660
I don't know if it'll come 
true, but it's a promise.

337
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,400
It will!

338
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,380
Oh, did you two already make up?

339
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,730
You know.

340
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,080
She finally understood how I felt.

341
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
You know.

342
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,270
Sakura-san.

343
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,970
Yes?

344
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,020
I think you should worry 
about yourself first.

345
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,610
I-I-I-I'm sorry!

346
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,530
<i>I hope you'll always be 
the kind person you are.</i>

347
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,170
Ko-chan looked really flustered.

348
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,700
Who's calling her?

349
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,440
It can't be!

350
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,380
I told you!

351
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,200
I work on Saturdays!

352
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,220
Mommy! I'm fine!

353
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm not a kid anymore.

354
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,580
What?!

355
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,930
Don't come to my home!

356
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,460
My mom will often come and clean my home.

357
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,650
So that's why your home is always clean.

358
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,840
Are you implying I'm messy?

359
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,450
I'd like to meet your 
mommy, one of these days.

360
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,620
But I don't call her "Mommy," okay?

361
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,930
Next time: "There Were Leaked Pictures 
of the Game on the Internet Yesterday!"

362
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

363
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
"There Were Leaked Pictures of 
the Game on the Internet Yesterday!"
