1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,310
<i>Stare...</i>

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>Gulp...</i>

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,030
Okay.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,090
Is this the last of the 
villagers I asked for?

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,160
It was so, so hard.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,480
Good job.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,250
I'm going to give you a designing job now.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,750
Here's the profile.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260
What?!

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,260
Aoba-chan, you're designing a character next?

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,270
Y-Yeah.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,030
We had to do it last year, too.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,490
It was right when our team had formed, 
so we were forced to do a contest.

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,270
A contest?

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,810
We all came up with designs and 
shared them with the group.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,760
I couldn't come up with anything, 
and my head started to hurt.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,250
Oh, yeah. You overheated.

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,450
That's when I realized I just 
like making characters move.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,280
What kind of character are you designing?

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,750
Let's see, an eighteen-year-old girl 
who just joined a circus troupe.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,190
Her light-colored hair in pigtails
is her distinguishing feature.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,430
She's sincere and energetic,
but slightly airheaded, as well.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,430
Wait, this sounds familiar.

24
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,430
<i>That's definitely Aoba-chan.</i>

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,640
She guides the main characters 
to the next dungeon...

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,520
And she gets killed by 
bandits in the process?!

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,350
<i>Poor girl.</i>

28
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,320
Character designing is hard.

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,270
Maybe I need some references.

30
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,690
<i>I wonder how she's doing.</i>

31
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,670
Pigtails

32
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,320
You have them on your head!

33
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,000
Noogie

34
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,000
Noogie

35
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,570
How are you doing?

36
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,300
Not good at all.

37
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,530
Let me see.

38
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,280
I see, you're just brainstorming.

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,850
None of them feel quite right.

40
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,870
And I've been so busy with work 
that I haven't been drawing at all.

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,240
If only I'd known this was my next project.

42
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,380
Stop making excuses.

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,730
You're right.

44
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,410
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,640
Yagami-san, were you in 
a contest at first, too?

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,870
Yeah.

47
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,620
I remember how frantically I drew.

48
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,880
That's how you got the job to 
design the main character, right?

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,660
Yeah.

50
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,190
Oh, that's right.

51
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,750
I was already the main 
designer when I was your age.

52
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:59,290
Though in your case, you have to surpass 
me first, so you won't have it easy.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,420
Wall

54
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,430
But that's why Ko-chan's 
senpais didn't like her,

55
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,910
and they picked on her a lot.

56
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,900
Hey!

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,270
What do you mean?

58
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,850
It doesn't feel good to have the 
main design stolen by some new hire,

59
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,400
fresh out of high school.

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,320
I-I acted a bit arrogant, too.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,060
That's why she came to me to rant every day.

62
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,830
Rin, stop.

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,830
I think I kind of get it.

64
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,380
When I discovered that you were 
the main designer at my age,

65
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,290
I felt a bit bitter...

66
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,250
and a bit envious, too.

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,170
Oh, what am I saying?

68
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,950
I need to grow up.

69
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,910
If I were in your shoes,

70
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,680
I would've felt the same way.

71
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,140
Because I love this job!

72
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,940
Did you have fun making the villager models?

73
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,030
Oh? Y-Yes.

74
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,530
I knew it wasn't an important job,

75
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,850
but I loved it.

76
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,750
I see.

77
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,740
That's good.

78
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,650
I put your villagers on the map,

79
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,960
and it's up on the server 
now, so take a look.

80
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,660
O-Okay.

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,990
Amazing!

82
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,050
I didn't know they looked 
like this inside the game!

83
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,680
It's important to feel bitter about defeat,

84
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,920
but when you have fun, 
it really shows in the product.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,030
I think that's what's important.

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,940
Yeah.

87
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,360
I had fun adding motion to your models, too.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,110
Yeah.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,990
A lot of people from planning,

90
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,970
motion, and programming were 
involved in this project.

91
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,370
I may have the job that 
gets recognized the most,

92
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,230
but I can't make everything alone.

93
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,300
That means your designs, too.

94
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
So don't forget that.

95
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,760
I-I'm suddenly feeling nervous 
from the responsibility.

96
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,800
By the way, if I become the main designer 
and become Yagami-san's supervisor,

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
I'll start by taking off the honorific.

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,770
Hey, Yagami. Come here.

99
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,350
That's when I'll leave the company.

100
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,590
Same here.

101
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,810
What about you?

102
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,160
I can't say for sure.

103
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,050
Why?

104
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm bitter, too.

105
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,930
Then stay bitter.

106
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,490
Yagami-san, I have a design!

107
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,540
Okay, it looks good.

108
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,270
Does she have a name?

109
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,340
Yeah, I did come up with one, but...

110
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,540
But...

111
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,980
It's really embarrassing to say her name.

112
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,010
Holding it in will only make it worse.

113
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,740
Her name's Sophia-chan!

114
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,190
Sophia-chan, huh?

115
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,030
Wait, is this me?

116
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,610
Did you just notice?

117
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,980
Unbelievable!

118
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,860
I hate you, Yagami-san!

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,490
Sophia-chan, don't be so grumpy.

120
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,370
Good work.

121
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,800
Tomorrow's Saturday, 
so you can get some rest.

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,220
Thank you.

123
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,920
Do you have any plans?

124
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,730
I'm going to a movie with a childhood friend.

125
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,610
Really?

126
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,650
That's nice.

127
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,630
I'm going to sleep all day tomorrow!

128
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,300
Mom, I'm hungry!

129
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,030
You're still in your PJs?

130
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,810
Why don't you get dressed?

131
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,220
But it's the weekend.

132
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,310
Mom, I want noodles!

133
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm working hard every 
day and earning my pay.

134
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,220
I want to really rest up on the days I can.

135
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,580
You're just like your father.

136
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,990
No!

137
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,170
Traffic Rangers

138
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,170
Signal Three

139
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,170
Hero Show

140
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,030
Everyone!

141
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,630
Thanks for coming!

142
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,310
Come back to cheer us on again!

143
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,520
Of course, Signal Three!

144
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,640
They're so awesome!

145
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,930
Iijima

146
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,410
Yun-neechan!

147
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,480
There, there.

148
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,580
What happened?

149
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,570
Miu hit me!

150
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,450
Miu, you're not supposed to hit.

151
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,620
Ren took my... doll... first!

152
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,540
Fine, I get it! Stop crying!

153
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,170
I'll take you somewhere 
nice if you stop crying.

154
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,550
You were still asleep?

155
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,210
I'll make you some food.

156
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,200
Can I come in?

157
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,970
You don't have to.

158
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,590
You have to take care of yourself.

159
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,430
It's good.

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,640
Thanks.

161
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,920
I wonder how the others are 
spending their weekend.

162
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,800
I have to go!

163
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm leaving!

164
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,100
<i>I haven't seen Nenecchi in so long.</i>

165
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,380
<i>She's childish, selfish, and a klutz,</i>

166
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,380
<i>and I think everyone calls her 
a middle schooler at college.</i>

167
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,930
<i>Oh, no.</i>

168
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,880
<i>Did she invite me today because 
she doesn't have any friends?</i>

169
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
Aocchi!

170
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,550
Sorry to keep you waiting!

171
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,720
Nenecchi, I'm always here for you!

172
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,060
What?

173
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,330
How rude!

174
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,370
Sorry.

175
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,860
It was just a guess.

176
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,570
I-I have plenty of friends!

177
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,500
I only invited you because I thought you'd 
be lonely without anyone your age at work.

178
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,310
O-Of course.

179
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,990
You're so nice, Nenecchi.

180
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,330
D-Don't flatter me.

181
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,210
Let's go buy our tickets.

182
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,190
We'll lose the good seats.

183
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,250
Yeah.

184
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,310
One student, and... one adult.

185
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,050
No!

186
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,430
Two adults!

187
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,240
Which one is it?

188
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,010
One student and one adult!

189
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,690
You should take advantage of the lower price.

190
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,900
It's not fair for you to pay 
more when we're the same age.

191
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,680
Then do you want to take 
the average of our tickets?

192
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,780
Fine, I'll pay for a bit of yours.

193
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,540
Popcorn!

194
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,470
I want popcorn!

195
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,510
They have salted, caramel, and...

196
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,210
The seasonal banana caramel flavor?

197
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,840
That sounds good!

198
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,420
Really?

199
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,260
Can I have the salted popcorn and melon soda?

200
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,140
So conservative.

201
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,680
Banana caramel is disgustingly sweet.

202
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,810
The flavor name didn't give it away?

203
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,550
We're giving out light 
sticks to small children.

204
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,810
Here you go.

205
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,990
Thank you!

206
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,320
I want one.

207
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,980
I want one, but I can't have one.

208
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,280
I'm an adult!

209
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,530
I bet you can get one, Nenecchi.

210
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,830
Here you go.

211
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,160
I can have one?

212
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,540
Of course.

213
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,210
<i>She actually got one.</i>

214
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,210
You can have one, as well.

215
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,180
Wait, me?

216
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

217
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,790
You swing it during the movie 
to cheer on Moon Ranger.

218
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,230
Cool, I didn't know that.

219
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,510
But I'm glad you could come today.

220
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,790
Oh, why's that?

221
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,820
Because if I invited my 
friends to watch this movie,

222
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,680
they'd really treat me like a child.

223
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,490
So you're aware of your childish taste.

224
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,790
Is this <i>Magical Girl Moon Ranger </i>
really worth watching in secret?

225
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,150
Of course!

226
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,510
It's nothing to scoff at just 
because it's made for kids.

227
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,710
It's going to be a major hit soon!

228
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,680
Does anyone at your work 
like anime like this?

229
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,800
Or does everyone just play games?

230
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,330
I'm sure they don't just play 
games, but I don't know.

231
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,690
My coworker who has a lot
of figures on her desk might like it.

232
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,970
You can decorate your desk with figures?

233
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,450
She has a ton of toys at her desk.

234
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,730
Maybe she's here in the theater.

235
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,170
No way.

236
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm already out.

237
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,700
You're so fast.

238
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,570
You can have some of mine.

239
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,990
Really?

240
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,330
It'll probably make me fat.

241
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,700
It'll Probably Make Me Fat

242
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,580
Actually, that's okay.

243
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,440
Why?

244
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,580
Because!

245
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,410
Oh, it's starting.

246
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,450
<i>You're here, Moon Ranger!</i>

247
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,220
<i>Help!</i>

248
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,840
<i>How dare you make kids cry?!</i>

249
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,940
<i>I'll make you pay!</i>

250
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,470
<i>Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!</i>

251
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,780
<i>Impossible.</i>

252
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,770
Wow, the story was so good.

253
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,380
I was actually a little moved.

254
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,910
I even swung the stick.

255
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,790
Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!

256
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,080
That's wrong.

257
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,460
Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!

258
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,210
They're both wrong.

259
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,800
Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!

260
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,810
But it was actually good, 
so I kinda want a pamphlet.

261
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,020
But I don't have the guts.

262
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,700
Are you not buying anything, Aocchi?

263
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,080
<i>Wow, she's brave.</i>

264
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,270
<i>But it's a bit embarrassing for me...</i>

265
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,580
Why are you blushing?

266
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,880
Shut up!

267
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,650
What are you buying, Nenecchi?

268
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,010
The pamphlet, the OST, and a poster...

269
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,330
Are what I want, but I don't have money, 
so I can only afford the pamphlet.

270
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,340
I got my first paycheck the other day.

271
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,000
Want to borrow some money?

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,820
N-No.

273
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,070
Lending and borrowing money 
will destroy our friendship.

274
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,430
I'm surprised you even know that.

275
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,830
But you're worried about our friendship.

276
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,760
I like that.

277
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,490
O-Of course.

278
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,270
Compared to the merchandise...

279
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,180
But I really want the merchandise, too...

280
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,320
Wh-What if you buy them for me,

281
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,780
and I take them off your 
hands when I have the money?

282
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,350
What?

283
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,510
If you don't come get them, 
it'll ruin our friendship.

284
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,780
I'm sure it'll be fine!

285
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,040
Starting today, your job will be to 
make a 3D model of Sophia-chan.

286
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,960
Sophia-chan's an important NPC 
who'll even be used in events,

287
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
She's sincere and energetic, but slightly airheaded, as well...

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Short Gloves

289
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Bloomers

290
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
so make sure you make her 
flashier than the villagers.

291
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Tights

292
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Guides the main characters to the next dungeon and gets killed by bandits

293
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Silk hat

294
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,760
Flashier?

295
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,370
There're only so many pixels 
you can use on the screen,

296
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,430
so we adjust the character 
density based on importance.

297
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,090
But Sophia-chan's going to die, right?

298
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,110
That's out of our hands.

299
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,110
Ko-chan, we need to go to a meeting.

300
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,510
Oh, right.

301
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,570
Organized

302
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,390
Whatever

303
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,100
<i>Which one should I strive to be?</i>

304
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,290
You'd better not be having weird thoughts.

305
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,790
What do they talk about in the meetings?

306
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,820
Oh, you don't know, Aoba-chan?

307
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,130
You can look at the proceedings 
on your computer.

308
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,570
What?

309
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,720
I didn't know that.

310
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,860
Basically, the team leads and 
directors meet up to make sure

311
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,560
there aren't any problems.

312
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,640
What happens when there are problems?

313
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,010
Like... the release is canceled...

314
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,060
That would be terrible!

315
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,590
But it's pretty rare.

316
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,190
*It's Common

317
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,740
Well, Iijima-kun,

318
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,900
how's your progress?

319
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,840
What are you talking about?

320
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,620
I'm imitating a meeting!

321
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm on schedule with one monster a week.

322
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,830
How is your progreâ€”

323
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,900
Excited

324
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,420
Never mind.

325
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,350
You look like you want to be asked.

326
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,750
How are you doing, Aoba-chan?

327
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,640
W-Well, I think you should ask Hajime-san first.

328
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,180
So basically, I'm doing well.

329
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,880
Okay.

330
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,370
How are you doing, Aoba-chan?

331
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,600
You didn't react!

332
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,440
And you say you're from Kansai?

333
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,910
I've had some delays,

334
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,840
but I got the green light on my design,

335
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,250
so I'm starting on the model today.

336
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,950
Aoba-chan, you're such a good 
girl who even reports the delays.

337
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,460
U-Um...

338
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,870
Hajime-san's looking at me with envy.

339
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,290
No, I'm not.

340
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,090
Hifumi-senpai, are you doing well?

341
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,730
The fact that the number 
of characters left...

342
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,210
and the number of days left...

343
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,340
don't match... scares me.

344
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,430
Wow, you're right.

345
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,300
Meeting in Progress

346
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,300
We're going to be busy.

347
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,570
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,560
I messed up the math.

349
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,230
I'll have to ask the character team to stay 
some nights or come in on the weekend.

350
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,640
Fun fact: a company order to come in on 
weekends earns you PTO, so it's kinda nice.

351
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Way to make light of a situation.

352
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,820
I'll come on the weekend, then.

353
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,390
Me, too.

354
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,260
And you, Aoba?

355
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,180
What's PTO?

356
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,540
We have to start there?

357
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,200
Look at what I got!

358
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,450
A sleeping bag!

359
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,740
You're going all out.

360
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,390
You're staying the night 
<i>and</i> coming on the weekend?

361
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,970
Just the first time.

362
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,100
I want to put a lot of time into Sophia-chan.

363
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,580
I even brought a change of clothes!

364
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,090
You sound like you're enjoying 
yourself, but this is overtime.

365
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,780
I know!

366
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,210
At night, only turn on the 
lights for your section.

367
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,960
Okay!

368
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,660
Boo!

369
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,740
Jeez.

370
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,870
If she didn't pull pranks like that,

371
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,540
I could actually respect her.

372
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,370
Whoa!

373
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,590
I didn't recognize you for a second.

374
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,670
You're cute, even when you dress like a slob.

375
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,180
Okay!

376
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,850
Let's do this!

377
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,310
1
Hour
Later

378
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,980
2 Hours Later

379
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,310
3 Hours Later

380
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,500
4 Hours Later

381
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,100
Aoba!

382
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,360
Aoba!

383
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,850
Where am I?

384
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,030
At work!

385
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,910
If you have a sleeping bag, sleep in there.

386
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,340
You're gonna get sick.

387
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,370
Oh, that's right.

388
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,770
I'm going to sleep soon, too.

389
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,520
Good night.

390
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,850
Good night.

391
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,730
Ta-da!

392
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,450
Bear sleeping bag!

393
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,130
Bear!

394
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,650
<i>Sleeping at work feels kinda weird.</i>

395
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,730
<i>And it's interesting to see something new.</i>

396
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,700
<i>I can't go to sleep with them watching me.</i>

397
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
Yagami-san.

398
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,610
Yagami-san.

399
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,130
I can't sleep.

400
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
Wh-What's that?

401
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,260
It's a bear sleeping bag.

402
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,090
If you can't sleep, you can sleep with me,

403
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,060
or the meeting room is a private 
room, so you can sleep there.

404
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,680
I'll go to the meeting room.

405
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,580
Okay, good night.

406
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,640
Good morning.

407
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,530
Good morning.

408
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,630
Morning.

409
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,370
Is Aoba-chan out for breakfast?

410
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,160
Meeting Room 1

411
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,160
Occupied

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,930
Aoba! Wake up!

413
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,710
Everyone's coming to work!

414
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,610
Aoba!

415
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,740
What?

416
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,110
You went to go watch the 
<i>Magical Girl Moon Ranger</i> movie?

417
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,930
Yeah.

418
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,620
My childhood friend invited me.

419
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,210
I went, too.

420
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,480
Right after watching a hero show.

421
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Really?

422
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,710
Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!

423
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,210
No, it's supposed to be 
Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!

424
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,090
You guys are both off.

425
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,200
Don't tell me... you went, too, Yun?

426
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,270
My brother and sister begged me 
to go, so I had to tag along.

427
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,290
That's it.

428
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,200
You <i>had</i> to go?

429
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,380
Really?

430
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,590
Really!

431
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,630
Is <i>Moon Ranger</i> popular?

432
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,260
Of course!

433
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,410
Everyone on my social network 
talks about it every day.

434
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,540
That's because you just follow 
people with the same hobbies.

435
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,560
Next time:
"Please Train the New Hires Properly."

436
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

437
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,000
"Please Train the New Hires Properly"
