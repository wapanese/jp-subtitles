1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,070
Yes, that's good.

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,920
I can't quite get the timing right.

3
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,770
Again.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,250
Come on.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,250
And she has panties on!

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,820
No bug found!

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,560
Hold it right there.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,690
What were you testing?

9
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,420
Someone wearing something or not?

10
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,540
Well...

11
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,310
We can't have anyone without panties.

12
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,810
That would indeed be a problem,

13
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,070
but you're not supposed to be able to 
see their underwear, so this is a bug.

14
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,760
Please note it.

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,600
Okay.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,820
No, that's in the specs.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,820
The secret specs.

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,710
What?

19
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,330
That's news to me.

20
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,440
Of course.

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,330
What's the fun in knowing you can do it?

22
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,510
The accidental panty shot.

23
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,590
That's where the dream is.

24
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,500
Not to mention it'd be a huge 
waste to keep the panties

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
the artists designed inaccessible.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,220
S-So true!

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,900
Very well.

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,890
Then please put "shots of 
underwear" in the specs.

29
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,660
It'll cause confusion.

30
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,420
Would we call them "undie shots" then?

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,240
It doesn't sound quite right.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,110
Umiko-kun's just being shy.

33
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,400
Don't comment on that.

34
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,820
You're not as mature as you act.

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,270
Shut your mouth.

36
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,760
Are you sick?

37
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,050
You okay?

38
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,030
Sorry.

39
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,460
I can't stop coughing.

40
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,800
If you're sick, you should go home.

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,590
You don't want to make everyone sick.

42
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,150
I'm fine.

43
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,690
It's just a cough.

44
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,690
And I can't take any breaks 
when we're so busy.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's go home.

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,610
You have to get some rest.

47
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,020
I'll take you home by force if I have to.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,680
F-Fine.

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,660
I'll go home by myself, 
so you can go back to work.

50
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,820
No.

51
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
You're gonna work at home.

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,330
How'd you know?

53
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,580
Easy.

54
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,370
We've been together all these years.

55
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm going to take Rin home, 
so take care of the rest.

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,010
You guys can handle things 
on your own, right?

57
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,910
We'll be fine,

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,430
but I didn't realize 
Toyama-san was badly ill.

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,960
Please take care.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,130
Not at all.

61
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,000
It's really nothing serious.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,180
Let's go home.

63
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,950
You're gonna get my team sick.

64
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,640
Ko-chan, it's not that serious.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,280
<i>I-I'm the oldest member here... now.</i>

66
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,810
<i>Double Moon Shower!</i>

67
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,770
Seriously, that's annoying!

68
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,260
Stop making so much noise!

69
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,370
Sorry.

70
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,140
I got carried away because 
our managers are gone.

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,000
I have to say, I was really surprised 
Yagami-san left early for Toyama-san.

72
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,530
Honestly, I've never seen her act so manly.

73
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,080
If I were Toyama-san, I might fall for her.

74
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,740
I thought Yagami-san was the type who'd say 
things like, "Get better with willpower!"

75
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,830
She's pretty strict, 
but she does have a soft side.

76
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,930
Goodness, you look dead.

77
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,140
I'm fine.

78
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,790
You're sweating a lot.

79
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,740
Let's wipe you dry and get you changed.

80
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,120
I'm too tired, so I'll just go to sleep.

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
No, you have to change.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,700
I'm looking through your drawers.

83
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,230
Okay.

84
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,860
Hm...

85
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,690
How do the wrinkles on a coat look?

86
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,660
Hajime-san, can I borrow the Dandy Max 
figure you have on your monitor?

87
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,410
Aoba-chan, you know who that is?

88
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,050
Y-Yes.

89
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,620
I watched it once on TV when I was little,

90
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,050
and it was interesting, 
so it just kinda stuck.

91
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,410
I see, so you knew.

92
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,930
It's an underrated masterpiece, 
so not many people know the movie.

93
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,120
The Real Figure series 
is super well made, too.

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,060
I can understand why it piqued your interest.

95
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,560
Isn't it just perfect?

96
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,640
Um, I... Yes.

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,570
It does look like him.

98
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,070
Even just a copy of myself draws people in.

99
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,660
Even this doll that only 
has 1% of what I have.

100
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,930
Dandy, dandy.

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,960
Oh!

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,180
The dandy talk!

103
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes!

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,850
<i>Oh, no.</i>

105
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,710
<i>I just wanted to see it for the coat.</i>

106
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,800
You're being too loud again.

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,710
<i>Thank goodness, a lifeline!</i>

108
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,530
But if you're talking about 
me, I can't stop you.

109
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,710
Fine, I'll join you in your conversation, 
but only for a little bit.

110
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,100
Dandy, dandy.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,930
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

112
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,140
You know it, too, Yun?

113
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,530
Hey! Are you talking about Dandy?

114
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,030
Th-This is crazy.

115
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,650
You know it, too, Nene-chan?

116
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,410
Come on.

117
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,990
My name was supposed to 
go in the history books.

118
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,490
Dandy!

119
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm surrounded by so many Dandy fans.

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,030
I'm so blessed!

121
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,000
Is it really something to celebrate about?

122
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,410
How did you feel when you 
first watched <i>Dandy Max</i>?

123
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,010
<i>Wh-What should I do?</i>

124
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,150
"What is this?"

125
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,010
I know!

126
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,760
<i>They're not supposed to be 
messing around right now.</i>

127
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,840
<i>I-I have to... say... something.</i>

128
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,390
U-Um...

129
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,890
What's with all the commotion?

130
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,650
You're still on the clock.

131
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,140
I understand you've loosened up a little 
with Rin-san and Ko-san gone,

132
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,180
but please work quietly 
during normal work hours.

133
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,650
That's common sense.

134
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,450
S-Sorry.

135
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,730
Sakura-san.

136
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,760
Go back to your desk.

137
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,200
O-Okay.

138
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,850
Sakura-san.

139
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,130
What did you come here to do?

140
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,200
Was it to see Suzukaze-san?

141
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,590
Are you here to play?

142
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:21,350
There is an 
electrical inspection 
this Saturday!!

143
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,140
No!

144
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,440
I was worried about Aocchi because she said

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,350
she had no summer break
and had to stay overnight.

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,150
You were worried about Suzukaze-san?

147
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,350
She spent a lot of time deciding 
whether to come here or go to college.

148
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,660
She had been accepted into an art 
college with her close friends,

149
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,920
but she chose to chase after her 
dream and decided to work here.

150
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,710
I was worried that the company she picked 
turned out to be a weird environment.

151
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,500
After working here, I see that 
it's a pretty good place.

152
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,640
Pretty good?

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,810
The reason I'm always roaming around is...

154
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,500
because of my personality, but...

155
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,900
I would never fool around when it comes 
to work that Aocchi is involved in!

156
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,210
I see.

157
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,650
Very well.

158
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,920
Your notes have been pretty thorough, 
so I'll believe you for now.

159
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,100
However, no matter how sincere you may be,

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,870
people can only make judgments 
based on your actions.

161
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,370
Do you understand?

162
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,170
Okay.

163
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,970
Sakura-san.

164
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,340
How long have you known Suzukaze-san?

165
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,520
Forever!

166
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,380
I mean, for a long time. We're neighbors,

167
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,920
so we've been together

168
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,090
from before preschool all
the way through high school.

169
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,690
That's pretty incredible.

170
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,520
I don't have any friends whom 
I've known for that long.

171
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,180
Yeah!

172
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,310
I've only known Aocchi for that long.

173
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,630
She can be a bit of a klutz, 
so she really needs me.

174
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,080
Here.

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,830
I made you porridge.

176
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,570
I heard a lot of noise over there.

177
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,020
Was everything okay?

178
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,580
Yeah. Of course.

179
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,080
All good.

180
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,420
I'm happy, but you can go back, Ko-chan.

181
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,830
We're busy.

182
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,160
Don't worry about me.

183
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,280
You should worry about getting better, Rin.

184
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,850
Can you eat it?

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,100
Feed me.

186
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,130
I said, feed me!

187
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,120
I think you're feeling better.

188
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,460
No.

189
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,320
I still feel lightheaded.

190
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,160
I don't want to drop it.

191
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,340
Jeez. This is the only time!

192
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,130
Here, open wide.

193
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,170
It's a little salty.

194
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,150
What?

195
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,480
How dare you?

196
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,700
So picky.

197
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,130
But it's good.

198
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,070
We can't come into work?

199
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,920
Yeah.

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,890
This weekend, they're doing 
a checkup on the power lines,

201
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,320
and you won't be able to use the computer,

202
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,920
so you wouldn't be able to 
do anything, even if you came in.

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,040
Rin-san and Ko-san both left early, 
so I figured you didn't know.

204
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,100
It looks like I was right.

205
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,920
Yay!

206
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,600
That means you can take a 
break this weekend, Aocchi!

207
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
Nenecchi.

208
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,050
But the schedule's tight.

209
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:47,360
Also, we've added underwear shots that 
can occur upon zooming in to the specs,

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,470
so some models will need corrections.

211
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,600
I believe you'll get the official 
notice through Rin-san later.

212
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,490
I found those.

213
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,320
That only adds more work.

214
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,130
Maybe I'll stay the night.

215
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,490
If I can't come in tomorrow, I'll stay, too.

216
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,850
M-Me, too.

217
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,570
If we have corrections to do.

218
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,930
You're all staying the night?

219
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,010
My team's not that busy, but...

220
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,870
if you're all staying the 
night, maybe I will, too!

221
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,200
You make it sound like a party,

222
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,080
but this is work, not a sleepover.

223
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,240
Is it because I found something 
weird that you have more work?

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,050
Not at all.

225
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,520
Don't worry about it, Nenecchi.

226
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,770
That's right.

227
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,270
It's not your fault, Sakura-san.

228
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,850
The blame goes to the person who 
nonchalantly changed the specs.

229
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,520
That's good, I suppose.

230
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,810
I know!

231
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,160
I'll stay the night too and help 
out by getting food and stuff.

232
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,740
There's no problem if I 
stay off the clock, right?

233
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,660
I think you'd only get in their way.

234
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,540
It's more than enough that 
we're in your thoughts.

235
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,250
Okay.

236
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,030
Don't work too hard.

237
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,180
Good night.

238
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,490
Good night.

239
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,010
Be careful, as it's dark outside.

240
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,170
Good night.

241
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,690
Sakura-san's a little weird.

242
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,130
Y-Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,830
But Nenecchi always lifts my spirits.

244
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,120
She said you guys go way back.

245
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,840
Yeah.

246
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,070
We've always been together.

247
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,440
It's only after finishing high school 
that we've gone our separate ways,

248
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,300
but she's a bit of a klutz,

249
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,600
so I'm a bit worried if she's 
doing fine in college without me.

250
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,230
It's nothing.

251
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,760
Sakura-san said the same thing.

252
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
The same thing?

253
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,730
It was nothing.

254
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,720
But just as Sakura-san 
said, don't work too hard.

255
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,370
If you fall ill from working too hard, 
then you won't get any work done.

256
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,480
I wouldn't want to make 
everyone worry, either.

257
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm tired.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,620
I think I'll go home.

259
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,350
What?

260
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,220
How can you when the trains just stopped?

261
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,450
So?

262
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,220
I ride my bike here, so it doesn't affect me.

263
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,340
I'm so jealous you live close.

264
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,810
My house is a little far.

265
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,370
But you two both live 
with your parents, right?

266
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,930
You're lucky you have the mattress 
ready when you get home.

267
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,030
I never realized that, but you're right.

268
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,840
Just because I live with my parents 
doesn't mean I don't do any chores.

269
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,650
In fact, if the trains operated 24/7, 
people could go home whenever they wanted!

270
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,360
Actually, I think the people 
who used the trains stopping

271
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,100
as an excuse to go home 
will never get to leave.

272
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,320
I see.

273
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,310
Um... Would you like some chocolates?

274
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,360
Oh, I'll take one.

275
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,790
Me, too.

276
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,610
Are you worried about your weight, Yun?

277
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,870
Of course! Midnight snacks are bad!

278
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,010
B-But if you're tired,

279
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,280
you need some sugar.

280
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,130
I suppose.

281
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,410
I'm all caught up.

282
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,950
I'm beat.

283
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,340
Same.

284
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,750
I'm dead.

285
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,480
Staying overnight isn't very 
efficient because you get tired.

286
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,990
I wonder what Yagami-san's made of.

287
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,970
She looks so thin and weak.

288
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,870
K-Ko-chan's just a hard worker, I think.

289
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,490
Then maybe I just don't have the will.

290
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,270
You're working hard just fine, Aoba-chan.

291
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,590
There's still time till the first train.

292
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,990
Want to sleep?

293
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,360
Or what should we do?

294
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,770
Yeah.

295
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,090
But I can't get any rest at work.

296
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,630
U-Um...

297
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,080
There's this thing nearby.

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,580
Relaxation Bath

299
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,580
That's great!

300
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,680
Nice idea, Hifumi-senpai.

301
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,590
Do you want to come, Hajime-san?

302
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,350
Sh-She's sleeping.

303
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,080
Hajime-san?

304
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,990
Wait.

305
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,040
<i>Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!</i>

306
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,350
Oh, I give up!

307
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,030
Where am I?

308
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,100
At work.

309
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,360
I feel so recharged.

310
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,190
So true.

311
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,890
It feels like this is what I've 
been working for this week.

312
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,090
You sound like an old man.

313
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,760
But I totally feel the same way.

314
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,990
Are you okay, Hajime-san?

315
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,780
Are you crazy, everyone?

316
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,010
The midnight price here is crazy high!

317
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,380
I was shocked.

318
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,390
True, it was a bit pricey.

319
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,020
But we rarely come here, so who cares?

320
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,230
I know, but...

321
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,210
The new weapons from <i>Signal 3</i> 
weren't exactly cheap.

322
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,290
With a new figure coming out next week,

323
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,020
I don't know how much I'll 
have left this month.

324
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,280
Then don't buy those toys.

325
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,620
I can't!

326
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,780
That's what I live for!

327
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,910
How do you live life on the edge?

328
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,630
I'd be scared.

329
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,430
I feel the same.

330
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,500
Do you have any hobbies, Hifumi-senpai?

331
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,540
Do you buy costumes for cosplay?

332
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,150
Oh, no.

333
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,080
I only do the simple stuff.

334
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,120
You have a really pretty body line, 
so I bet you look good in anything.

335
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,580
N-Not at all.

336
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,310
It's not fair.

337
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,110
Wh-What was that for?!

338
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,960
Sorry.

339
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,160
Looking at you pissed me off.

340
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,920
I don't get it,

341
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,510
but what goes around comes around!

342
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,840
Get back here!

343
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,010
They get along so well.

344
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,680
No, we don't!

345
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,840
Oh... Now you've done it!

346
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,070
You're gonna get it!

347
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,020
There!

348
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,270
<i>N-No one splashes me.</i>

349
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,820
Hifumi-senpai, gotcha!

350
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,910
I-I'm sorry, Hifumi-senpai!

351
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,390
No.

352
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,580
Thank you.

353
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,270
That felt so good.

354
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,450
And I got a lot of sleep, too.

355
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,960
Morning!
How was work?
Did you get any rest?

356
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,200
Nenecchi.

357
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,160
Hey, Nenecchi?

358
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,220
Morning.

359
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,410
I'm on my way home.

360
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,640
Yeah, I slept.

361
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,910
We all went to a bathhouse together.

362
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,380
What?

363
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,230
We weren't playing.

364
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,510
We were working!

365
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,990
What?

366
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,040
Yagami-san and Toyama-san aren't coming in?

367
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,660
Yagami-kun caught Toyama-kun's cold.

368
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,580
Toyama-kun's still healing up.

369
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,090
Will they both be all right?

370
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,600
They both work too much every day, anyway.

371
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,240
They need to get their rest.

372
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,270
Also, we should be careful of the cold,

373
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,190
so let's get some nutrients.

374
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,410
That looks delicious!

375
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,020
Would you like one, Sakura-kun?

376
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,500
Thank you.

377
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,120
I love you, Hazuki-san.

378
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,280
I know.

379
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,610
Why don't you take one to Umiko-kun?

380
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,130
I think she'll like it.

381
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,740
Really?

382
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,130
Really.

383
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,280
She's not so hard to please.

384
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,540
Excuse me.

385
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,860
Oh, she's not here.

386
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,540
I figured she'd be into military stuff.

387
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,510
Sakura-san?

388
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,030
I-I-I'm sorry.

389
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,090
Sakura-san, you're unbelievable.

390
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,390
Everyone, it was nice working with you all.

391
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,810
Nenecchi, what's going on?

392
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,650
Aocchi.

393
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,040
She's going to be working 
next to me from now on,

394
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,840
so that she can focus on her debugging work.

395
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,810
You won't get to play anymore.

396
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,180
I'm scared!

397
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,630
We're reaching our final 
development stage, Umiko-kun.

398
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,460
Indeed.

399
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,080
Is it turning out to be a good game?

400
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,760
It's so-so.

401
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,150
I'll need to write a new set 
of specs to improve theâ€”

402
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,800
Don't shoot me!

403
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,930
Next time: "Full-time Employment is a 
Loophole in the Law to Make Wages Lower."

404
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
Next Time

405
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,000
"Full-time Employment Is a Loophole in the Law to Make Wages Lower"
