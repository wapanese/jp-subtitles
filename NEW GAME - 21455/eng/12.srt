00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,740
9:15 @ Shinjuku East Exit
 Okay

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,740
Okay!!

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,740
Okay

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,190
Let's see, the place we're meeting is...

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,010
<i>I wonder what Yagami-san's doing.</i>

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,260
Good morning!

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,090
You're early.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,080
I'm the only one here.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,790
You were looking at it intensely.

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,290
Yeah.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,840
They really treat us well.

13
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,740
Sale starts at 10:00!

15
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,740
Wow!

End of Line

17
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,490
There's a small line already!

18
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,920
Hajime-san and Hifumi-senpai are 
supposed to be here already.

19
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,180
But I don't see them.

20
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,630
No, look.

21
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,630
They're in line...

22
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,370
We're staff, so I thought 
we'd receive a copy for free.

23
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,060
They want the extra goods.

24
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,730
Rin and I get them because we're leads,

25
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,210
but you only get the game.

26
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,070
What?

27
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,960
That's not fair.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,640
We don't get them.

29
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,150
They had to cut costs, 
so we only get the game, too.

30
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,030
I'm gonna go get in line!

31
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,610
Oh, me, too!

32
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,660
So we're all lining up?

33
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,530
End of Line
Please Line Up Here

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,530
Why?

35
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,120
Why are we lined up for the 
game we created ourselves?

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,490
You didn't have to join us.

37
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,770
Yeah, but I don't want to regret it later.

38
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,430
Yeah.

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,830
But I'd be letting the free one go to waste.

40
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,970
What should I do?

41
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,170
You could sell it.

42
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,120
You're a genius!

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,970
Gimme a break.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,310
This brings me back.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,520
Start of Line

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,930
For our first game, we lined up like this.

47
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,280
You couldn't get the extra goods,

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
so I got in line with you.

49
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,700
You remember?

50
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,480
Of course I do.

51
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
It was just the two of us back then,

52
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,490
but we have a whole party now.

53
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,580
Yeah.

54
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,760
We do.

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
Fairies Story 3

56
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
Day 1 Sale!

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,270
We will now start selling <i>Fairies Story 3</i>!

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,320
Who's that?

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,400
Do you know her?

60
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,280
I think she just works here.

61
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,010
Thank you for waiting!

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,910
But it's nice to see a cosplay of Karen-chan.

63
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,500
Come on in!

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,890
No, if you look closely, the design is off.

65
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,210
Who cares?

66
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,410
It's the thought that counts.

67
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,520
See? Everyone loves it.

68
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,420
So cute!

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
I know, but it just bugs me.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,140
Hey, Miss!

71
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,170
Can you strike a pose like this?

72
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,220
L-Like this?

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,200
Yeah, that's it!

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,900
That's the pose she makes.

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,600
You're very knowledgeable.

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,190
We're actually part of the staff.

77
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,150
She's so happy.

78
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,860
Don't tell anyone.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,470
I guess it's fine.

80
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,880
Yeah.

81
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,740
Everyone looks so happy.

82
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,360
Let's hope they don't get disappointed.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,490
Stop it.

84
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,820
I'm feeling sick thinking about it.

85
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,860
That's true.

86
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,160
It's nerve-wracking
to be on the selling side.

87
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,840
It's much less stressful just to buy.

88
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,720
Next customer, please.

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,970
Oh, yes!

90
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,190
<i>Still...</i>

91
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,470
<i>This makes me so happy.</i>

92
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,980
I've been looking forward to this, too.

93
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,730
Really? Thank you so much!

94
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,560
I mean, me, too!

95
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,110
Hey, they're back.

96
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,160
You should've just gotten in line with us.

97
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,470
I'm glad we didn't.

98
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,070
You told them you were staff.

99
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,120
Who cares?

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,910
This doesn't happen every day.

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,040
People are staring, thanks to you.

102
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,000
Really?

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,270
Am I a celebrity now?

104
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,360
No!

105
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,170
Did you buy two, Hajime-san?

106
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,410
Oh, this?

107
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,780
It's for Nene-chan.

108
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,570
For Nenecchi?

109
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,890
Speak of the devil.

110
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,470
Hey, gang!

111
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,520
I got the other store's extra goods!

112
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,940
You're a hero!

113
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,010
Good work!

114
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,680
Didn't even break a sweat.

115
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,650
When did they get so close?

116
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,720
There are store specific drama CDs 
with different characters and stories.

117
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,740
Yeah.

118
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,170
They're all spin-offs of the main characters,

119
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,240
so you can't miss any of them.

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,290
We have the original audio
files at the office.

121
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,910
You're such a sad person.

122
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,460
It's all about owning limited edition copies!

123
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,510
You two are like twins.

124
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,370
You guys all bought the limited edition, too.

125
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,580
You get the game for free.

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,010
I wanted one as a memento.

127
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,800
Which drama CD does this store have?

128
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,230
Karen, the heroine.

129
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,110
I think that's why they 
have her cosplay here.

130
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,730
What should I do?

131
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,020
I like Knight, too, so I want that, too...

132
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,610
Marketing is scary.

133
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,620
My favorite is his best friend, Conner-kun.

134
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,420
I didn't expect he'd turn to the dark 
side and become the final boss, though.

135
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,210
Totally!

136
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,890
That was a huge surprise!

137
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,210
But I did like how his way of thinking 
differed from the pacifist Knight.

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
So the one on one at the end...

139
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,840
H-Hey, Nenecchi!

140
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,760
Conner's the final boss?

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,310
Didn't she say she was staff earlier?

142
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,100
Shoot.

143
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,220
Let's leave.

144
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh, no!

145
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,320
We're in trouble.

146
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,740
We're in deep trouble.

147
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,910
Maybe even fired!

148
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,870
We'll be fine!

149
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,780
Aoba-chan.

150
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,450
Look.

151
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,410
Wait, Conner's the final boss?

152
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,410
It's all over the Internet!

153
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,240
That's way too soon!

154
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,670
Th-That can't be us!

155
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,520
It's probably people who got the 
game early and beat it already.

156
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,890
Oh, that makes sense.

157
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,170
Let's just say that's what happened.

158
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,540
Jeez!

159
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,380
Way to ruin the game's release!

160
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,050
Second round!

161
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,290
You were right.

162
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,590
The people who got them early are 
posting their thoughts already.

163
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,180
When can we write about the story?

164
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,440
Looks like we weren't responsible, then.

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,420
Of course.

166
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,980
It spread way too fast.

167
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,030
Say what you want, but leaking 
information is a crime.

168
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,430
You have to be more careful.

169
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,660
I-I know.

170
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,160
We'll be more careful now.

171
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,650
Right?

172
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,340
Yeah.

173
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,370
I won't say Sophia-chan dies—

174
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,250
You just said it.

175
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,710
Sakura-san.

176
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,880
What did you do this time?

177
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,070
Umiko-san.

178
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,760
What's up?

179
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,140
Did you buy it for the
extra goods, too, Ahagon?

180
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,170
Don't call me that.

181
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,640
Okay.

182
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,280
So, what did you do, Sakura-san?

183
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,110
N-Nothing.

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,650
Really?

185
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,630
Excuse me!

186
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,350
Which drama CD did your store have?

187
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,660
My favorite is Cruyff.

188
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,670
It's his backstory, 
about his days in training.

189
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,680
Oh!

190
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,990
The man who's really good with his weapons?

191
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,530
So you really like weapons, huh, Ahagon?

192
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,120
I have places to be, so goodbye.

193
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,180
Oh, I almost forgot.

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,070
This was at the office, so I borrowed it.

195
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,400
Yagami-san, you look super cute!

196
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,640
I didn't know you could look like this.

197
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,360
You're really cute.

198
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
You look so timid, too.

199
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,590
So cute.

200
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,160
I'll have to buy that later.

201
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,910
I wonder if bookstores 
already have them on sale.

202
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,440
I hate this!

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,010
Reception

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,010
Celebration Party 
Hall

205
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,430
I didn't realize so many 
people were involved.

206
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,440
They invited everyone in the credits, 
including third-party partners.

207
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,370
Even I was invited.

208
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,840
What's more, one of the voice actresses
is here, so I'm gonna ask for an autograph.

209
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,700
Me, too! Me, too!

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,450
You two are well-prepared.

211
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,370
Hey, it's Yagami-san.

212
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,810
I'm Yagami Ko, and I was in 
charge of the characters team.

213
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,770
Well... Uh...

214
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,020
I forgot what to say.

215
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,480
Sorry, I'm not used to this.

216
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,790
Just be yourself!

217
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,470
Yagami-san! You can do it!

218
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,470
I've been involved as a character 
designer since the first installment,

219
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,330
and I've gone through a lot 
over the past seven years.

220
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,710
There were a lot of hardships.

221
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,720
However, I only remember having fun 
in the process of making this game.

222
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,850
I want to thank everyone who worked on it,

223
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,140
and let's keep making great games.

224
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,080
Next, please welcome our director, Hazuki.

225
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,330
I never thought I'd hear 
a "thank you" from Yagami.

226
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,500
It didn't happen seven years ago.

227
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,340
I'm Hazuki Shizuku, the director.

228
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,180
Thanks to everyone, the game is selling well.

229
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,740
I think this will help us in moving forward.

230
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,260
Just as Yagami said earlier,

231
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,480
it's been seven years since the 
start of the first installment.

232
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,500
Some of you have been 
with us since the start.

233
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,020
Some have joined partway.

234
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,490
We were able to bring the game to a release 
thanks to a vast number of people.

235
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,320
Thank you, everyone.

236
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,990
And now, a toast!

237
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,750
Cheers!

238
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,770
I'm surprised that Hazuki-san 
gave such a serious speech.

239
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,260
She wasn't just some weirdo after all.

240
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,870
That's disrespectful.

241
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,550
Please enjoy the party.

242
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,260
Let's go get her autograph!

243
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,690
Yes, sir!

244
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,210
Those guys...

245
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,930
Aoba-chan...

246
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,980
Yes?

247
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,430
Can you come with me?

248
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,900
You, too?

249
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,610
Excuse me.

250
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,830
Can we get an autograph?

251
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,150
Sure.

252
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,600
Go, Hifumi-senpai!

253
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,990
U-Um...

254
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,930
I've been your fan since <i>Moon Ranger</i>.

255
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,750
Oh, thank you!

256
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,830
Mega Particle Requiem Shoot!

257
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,080
Right?

258
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,590
I know that move!

259
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,970
The movie was really good!

260
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,380
You're late to the party!

261
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,680
Aocchi, you should've asked 
her to sign something.

262
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,140
Huge Sales Celebration Party

263
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,830
I'm fine.

264
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,150
Besides, I've already decided on a 
person to get an autograph from.

265
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,050
Who's that?

266
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,900
Not telling.

267
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,270
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,350
Oh, good evening!

269
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,640
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for!

270
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,460
It's time for the lottery!

271
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:21,450
Our grand prizes are the two PZ4 
consoles donated to us by Hobundo!

272
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,710
Oh, I forgot to pick up a number.

273
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,450
You can get one now at the reception desk.

274
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,600
Really?

275
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,800
There are various other
prizes available, as well,

276
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,410
I'll be right back.

277
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,890
so if you don't have a number,
please head over to the reception desk.

278
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,090
She's so energetic.

279
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,100
Oh!

280
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,720
Yagami-san, your speech was really good.

281
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,310
Man, I was so nervous.

282
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,820
But I felt better after hearing your voice.

283
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,040
Hazuki-san! Again?

284
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,150
I forgot to get Yagami's speech earlier, 
so I needed a replacement.

285
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,540
No, you didn't!

286
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,280
You did a great job, too, Suzukaze-kun.

287
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
You made Sophia popular.

288
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,820
Thank you!

289
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,550
Looks like Yagami was 
right to give her to you.

290
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,540
I-I just gave it to her for fun.

291
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,980
I'll leave it at that, then.

292
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,300
I plan to make her the art director next,

293
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,340
so keep her in check for me.

294
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,680
That's incredible!

295
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:21,940
Wait!

296
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,950
Me? An AD?

297
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,880
Let Rin do it again!

298
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,400
I need Toyama-kun to become a 
co-producer with the current producer.

299
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,870
It was her request.

300
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,570
She didn't say anything.

301
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,650
People wouldn't follow me.

302
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,010
You think so?

303
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,380
I won't force you to do it.

304
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,770
Just think about it.

305
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,640
Lucky Box

306
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,610
And the next number for 
the third place prize...

307
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,490
Number 87!

308
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,430
Me! Me! Me!

309
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,850
From Ahagon-san of the programming 
team, an N16 Assault Rifle model gun.

310
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,400
It's Umiko, not Ahagon.

311
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,350
Interesting that it's going to you.

312
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,530
Take it as my appreciation 
for your debugging.

313
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,730
What?

314
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,980
I don't want it.

315
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,270
Wow, she said it.

316
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,670
I agree that a BK47 suits you better.

317
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,130
I don't even know what you're talking about!

318
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,800
It's a more dangerous weapon.

319
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,220
I don't really understand military stuff.

320
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,530
Maybe you'd have more interest if you 
looked into the manufacturing history.

321
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,560
Really?

322
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,890
Then I'll be sure to read up on it 
before the next work I'll be debugging.

323
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,500
Unfortunately, we plan to hire a 
professional company in the future,

324
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,820
so we won't be hiring you next time.

325
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,450
Are you okay?

326
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:03,580
I can't draw, I'm not smart, 
and I'm not creative.

327
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,670
Does this mean this is goodbye?

328
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,960
I think that's up to you.

329
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,970
Please contact me if you need something.

330
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,550
Umiko-san!

331
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,970
Don't come whining to me, though.

332
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,370
Let's get one on "shoot."

333
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,510
Okay.

334
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,030
Let's move on to the two grand prizes.

335
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,820
Oh, Yagami-san!

336
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,290
Huh? Where is she?

337
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,170
Yagami-san?

338
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,040
Are you curious as to why Yagami 
doesn't want to be an AD?

339
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,250
She used to be an AD.

340
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,680
For <i>Fairies 2</i>.

341
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,170
I didn't know.

342
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,680
She must have been very young.

343
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,690
It was a difficult experience for her.

344
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,990
She's always such a hard worker,

345
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,920
so she ended up being 
really strict with everyone.

346
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,060
Some people just couldn't take it.

347
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,030
A new hire like you quit in six months.

348
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,260
I still remember her 
being depressed about it.

349
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,800
In the end, someone else took over, 
and the game was completed,

350
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,570
but she strongly rejected
the position for the third game.

351
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,430
But...

352
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,250
I guess it means she's always 
been a generous person.

353
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,390
Why do you say that?

354
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:54,980
Because if she didn't care, she wouldn't 
get depressed over other people's pain.

355
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,150
Yeah, I agree.

356
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,940
Oh, didn't you want to talk to her?

357
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,980
Yeah, where did she go?

358
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,570
She's probably taking a break outside.

359
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,660
Go get her.

360
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,780
Yeah!

361
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,350
I'll go find her.

362
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,980
You really are taking a break.

363
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,980
Aoba.

364
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,910
I'm just not that comfortable around a crowd.

365
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,870
Then I'm going to take a break, too.

366
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,230
You're not that tired.

367
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,110
You can go back to the party.

368
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,830
That's not true!

369
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,670
I get tired, too.

370
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,900
And... Um...

371
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,430
Um, can I ask you a favor?

372
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,710
C-Can I have your autograph?

373
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,430
Oh.

374
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,190
That's why you came.

375
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,490
Sure.

376
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,960
Here.

377
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,720
Thank you.

378
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,680
One of my dreams came true.

379
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,640
You're making me blush.

380
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,970
I'm really grateful to you, Yagami-san.

381
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,710
You taught me a lot of things,

382
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,330
and you always subtly came to talk to me.

383
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,480
Those small things really made me happy.

384
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,860
I don't know how you were in the past, but...

385
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,360
But I know for a fact...

386
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,000
I know for a fact that you're 
a supervisor I look up to.

387
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,250
So if you become the art director, 
I will definitely follow your lead!

388
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:30,630
B-But we might not even be on the same team.

389
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,930
What, really?

390
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,020
Just kidding.

391
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,440
We'll probably be together.

392
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,280
But I feel more confident now.

393
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,150
A bit.

394
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,890
Thanks, Aoba.

395
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,150
Hey, they're back.

396
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,430
Goodness.

397
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,920
One of our partners was looking for you.

398
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,160
Oh!

399
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,380
Yagami-san, I should get your autograph, too.

400
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,830
Just be honest and say you want it.

401
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,580
Welcome back.

402
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,480
Thanks for bringing her back, Aoba-chan.

403
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,500
Of course!

404
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,000
Kirara Police Twenty-Four!!
Caught on Security Cameras

405
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,020
<i>Kirara Police Twenty-Four!</i>

406
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,690
La la la...

407
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,980
Ow.

408
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,020
Oh, sorry.

409
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,760
Hey, ****-san!

410
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,610
That's a pole!

411
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,110
Jeez, you drank way too much...

412
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,780
Yeah...

413
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,370
Are you okay?

414
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,910
But you're lucky there wasn't any

415
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,870
<i>ko</i>llateral damage.

416
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,580
Just kidding!

417
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,500
Ahahahahahahaha!

418
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,800
Is everything okay?

419
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

420
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,300
It's already very late.

421
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,550
It's dangerous for young ladies to be out so late.

422
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,140
What are you doing?

423
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,890
Don't leave me beh—
